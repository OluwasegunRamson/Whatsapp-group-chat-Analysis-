[06/01/2024; 14;13;18] ; Tailad; *There is something going on In most of the BIG supermarket in Nigeria. I don't know if you have noticed it too?*

I went to the Supermarket with Shalewa yesterday and as I was selecting the things am buying; I was calculating it cos I had a budget not to spend more than a particular amount. 

So everything I calculated was 27k.
On getting to the counter; the Girl at the counter scanned all the items and I gave her my ATM card.
I was surprised to see 31k on my print out recept which has been deducted from my account. 

Immediately I told her I want to see the manager and I took the matter up with them and we calculated everything manually together and the manager saw that it was 27k; so how did 27k turn to 31k? 

This is a day light Robb£ry and am not going accept it and in the cause of my drama at the supermarket. 3 other persons also calculated their items manually and saw that they were overcharged. 

The manager was begging that Mr Atanda Olatunji; it was a mistake. 

Is the manager trying to tell me that their machine is making error to overcharge Customers ? 

I have evidences from the other 3 people and have gotten their contacts as they promised me that they are ready for this case. Cos their own over charging is even much more than my own. 

Pls; start calculating things you buy in those BIG supermarket manually before you get to the counter. 

We must fish out those Supermarket that over charge people this New Year. 

I will be happy if you can share this post to create more awareness; because once many people are aware of this Fr@ud by the supermarkets; people will start calculating manually and we will know those Supermarket that are doing wayo.

 Don’t fight the closed doors; the disappointments; the people that walk away. 

You don’t know what God is up to. 

Sometimes; He has to move you away from what you’re comfortable with.

People can’t override what God has ordained for you. 

Bad breaks; delays; detours; injustice can’t stop your destiny. 

God uses them to move you into your destiny.

Trust in God's plan for your life; bad breaks; delays; and detours are part of the journey; shaping and redirecting you towards your destined path. 

Keep faith and persevere.

What to know 
- The cNGN is a stable coin that will allow you to transact anywhere in the world using the Naira.
- ⁠The cNGN will allow you to purchase and sell goods at the official CBN rate.

- ⁠The cNGN will eliminate the traditional challenges of currency conversion and hefty international transaction fees. 

- ⁠It is similar to other stable coins like USDT and USDC and will join other currencies that can be used to trade from any part of the world.

- ⁠It is expected to reduce and eventually eliminate the manipulation of the Nigerian currency by middlemen and currency changers.

- ⁠Unlike the eNaira; which is developed solely by the apex bank; the cNGN is managed by a consortium; the Africa Stablecoin Consortium (ASC).

The cNGN is part of the Central Bank’s efforts to ensure the Naira becomes a stable currency that can be relied on by investors and users across the globe.

The former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor; Mr. Godwin Emefiele; has reportedly refunded a whopping N4 trillion to the coffers of the Federal Government stolen while he was the at the helm of affairs of the apex bank.

According to a source close to the investigators; besides reportedly returning N4 trillion; Emefiele also allegedly gave up ownership of six banks linked to him.

In a related development; the source revealed that a former CBN Deputy Governor; Tunde Lemo; also reportedly refunded $500 million embezzled taxpayers’ money.

The most shocking of all; however; was the discovery of $275 million in the bank account of a six year old son of Sabiu Yusuf; a.k.a Tunde; a Personal Assistant to former President Muhammadu Buhari.

Also discovered was another N1.5 trillion in the personal account of the former Personal assistant to former President Buhari.

The source said; “The Special Investigator; Jim Osayande Obazee and his committee; allegedly discovered $275 million in an account in a new generation bank belonging to six years old son of Sabiu Yusuf.

“Another N1.5 trillion also allegedly traced to Yusuf; a very influential member of the former President Mohammadu Buhari’s Govt.

“President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is currently negotiating; using some influential Nigerians on how to refund the funds without being exposed.

“Only recently; National Security Adviser; NSA; Nuhu Ribadu; lamented that the current administration inherited a bankrupt country from the Buhari’s government due to the large scale looting that occurred then.”

It could be recalled that Tinubu employed the services of Mr. Obazee; a Special Investigator; to investigate the activities of CBN under Emefiele and related entities.

So far; Obazee has recovered over N12 trillion looted mostly by members of the former President Buhari’s administration.

The source also claimed that the committee has also rejected several millions of Dollars in bribe offers from former members of the Buhari’s Government to avoid being arrested and exposed.*

[08/01/2024; 16;31;48] ; EASY LIFE VENTURES; *BE CAREFUL HOW YOU INSULT PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA*

Social Media has made us not know who our mates are any longer. 

Because each of us is holding a smartphone and has data to post; we don't take a minute to reflect on the possible personality of the person at the other end communicating  with us.

And I will share a personal experience. 

Few days ago; I shared a content on a particular WhatsApp platform which attracted a few positive comments from members of the group.

But someone slid into my dm and made some observations on things I could improve on the project.

I didn't know him or her from anywhere (but from the way he spoke I could almost tell he or she is my junior). Well; for me; that doesn't really matter. I just said "Thank you; I appreciate" and let him go.

The next day; I implemented about 90% of his or her recommendations. 

Then I did something that only a few people would consider doing. 

I went back to the person; submitted the latest version of the work; and asked for further criticism (critics are one of the greatest assets you have on any project; unfortunately; most people don't know this).

He or she looked at it and confessed that I have a near-perfect work.

I thanked him or her.

But then; I went back again; introduced myself; and requested to know more about whoever he or she is if he or she doesn't mind.

At that point; I was expecting to get just the name and maybe gender so as to enable me to save the number accordingly. 

But I was shocked what I got instead. 

I received a detailed profile of a man whose first son is about my age mate.

As at the time the man started his career with UNICEF; I wasn't born yet. He had gone ahead to work as a consultant to United Nations for over 20 years.

He spends at least 9 months outside Nigeria each year with his children living in UK; US; and Canada - but see me in the same WhatsApp group with him.

After my conversation with him; I sat back and reflected on the different dramas I have seen on social media.

I have watched people insult people they have no idea what their profile is; especially on a WhatsApp Group. 

Sometimes you may share a post and someone drops a comment that is not too complimentary and the next thing that will follow will be loads of insults. 

In fact; I have watched one C-suite exec exit a particular WhatsApp Group with tears because of the insult he received from a young girl in the group (obviously the girl had no idea of whom the person is while releasing her poison).

This is quite common on Alumni WhatsApp Group.

Imagine you are in NIFES Alumni WhatsApp Group. On that platform; there are people that graduated in 1980 and there are people that graduated in 2021. 

But they both have one thing in common - they are both alumni. And with that common factor; they are both entitled to be on the same platform without any form of discrimination. 

Now; you would imagine that the person that graduated in 1980 may have retired as a Director in CBN; he might be the owner of one of the best hospitals in US; he might be a Professor at Imperial College or a senior executive at Google. 

Of course; the person that graduated in 2021 might still be doing NYSC.

So imagine that on one of those occasions; a controversial issue like why Peter Obi must not win 2023 election is raised on the platform and our NYSC guy starts raining insults on the Imperial Professor for holding a different view.

I want you to just imagine that for a minute.

We also see this happen on Facebook comments.

Sometimes you just notice a comment on someone's post. Of course; you don't know the person who dropped the comment neither do you care to know. But all you know is that the person must be "a bastard and a very useless person" for saying that and that is exactly what you drop as your own reply.

Friends; 

I have an advice for you today.

Don't allow that device you are holding to deceive you. We are together on this blue App and on other social platforms; we share jokes and learn from each other; but we are not mates.

Resist the temptation of saying "Who do he think he is; he should get out from here".

Respect for elders is not only for those in your village; it also applies on this Social Media street. Unfortunately; you can't even recognise who an elder is here - so just respect everyone; and respond to them with courtesy and deep respect.

[08/01/2024; 22;39;46] ; Adeyemi; UPDATE

Sen.Ali Ndume; has raised the alarm over what he called an emerging cabal in the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Says “The president must act swiftly and dismantle the cartel.”

Senator Ndume; who commended President Tinubu for his suspension of embattled Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation; Betta Edu; for proper investigation of financial sleaze in her ministry; however; declared that the axed Minister did not act alone but with connivance with certain individuals who have since formed a cartel in the Tinubu Presidency.

He cautioned that; if not curtailed; the emerging political cabal could destabilise the administration of President Tinubu.

He said; “What President Tinubu has done is very timely. The suspension of the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs is a welcome development. It will allow the relevant agencies to conduct a proper investigation.

“Some people in the same position Tinubu is in would not have acted. But as the leader in charge; he acted swiftly; and the minister has been suspended. We should commend the president. This is something Nigerians should commend.

“But the president should not stop there. There is an emerging political cartel within the corridors of power. The president must act swiftly and dismantle the cartel.

“If they’re not stopped; they’ll be stronger and worse than the cabal. The president must not allow that to happen. I don’t think what the minister did was an isolated case. I don’t think she acted alone.

“The President needs to look deep and flush out those involved in mismanaging the funds meant for humanitarian assistance.
We’re hopeful that the President will take more decisive actions in the future.”

[09/01/2024; 06;49;28] Comrade Obadina; Agbado oke Odo youth are very articulate and brilliant;but we have being used against ourselves;reason why those that supposed to have retired or move to state remain at the local level.

2025 is around the Conner;they have come again with their antics to distract us.

I have refused to join hand to hate who didn't offend me;it against my spirit and humanity.

Despite not being at the GAC meeting we know what happened their and result ll soon come out.

Either 2;3 or 4 factions let keep our fingers crossed.

My advice to those with aspiration is to be themselves and not rely much on people but God.

Peace is cheaper if we are truly sincere about it.

Advocating for peace without Deliberate efforts amounts to dishonesty and lack of integrity.

Most of the youth just want to be noticed by fueling the ember of violence to score cheap recognitions.

The youths leaders across Alimosho have pitched tents already to a group or leadership because of selfish motives and interest.

To reverse it to what we experienced during AYM array we must all ready to shun mediocracy and nepotism; greed; hateful statements and ready to honor those honored are dueling for without comparison.

All the actors no what they are doing!

They all wants to control power that can only be given freely by the majority because that is the system of government we are running.

[09/01/2024; 10;06;23] Alfa Gafaru Council; More details have emerged regarding the suspension of the embattled Minister of Humanitarian Affairs Disaster Management; Dr. Edu Betta by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to pave the way for investigation on alleged misappropriation of funds belonging to the National Social Investment Programme Agency (NSIPA).

Exclusive details gathered by Podium Reporters that when the suspended Minister got wind of her imminent suspension; she rushed down to the Aso Rock villa with her convoy and tried to see the President without a prior appointment. She was; however; restricted to the President's waiting room where she watched on TV as News Channels announced her suspension.

When it became apparent; she was not going to see the President; Dr. Edu Betta came outside but found out that her entire security details and vehicles that accompanied her convoy were gone. It was gathered that the security details received signals recalling them to their respective commands following her suspension.

The Villa Access Tag of the embattled Minister was also taken from her by the DSS. It took the intervention of one of the principal aides to the president; who volunteered to use his vehicle to give Dr. Betta Edu ride out from the villa.

[09/01/2024; 15;11;18] ; femiOJO; The company linked to him wasn't part of the over 500m.

1. Tunji-Ojo did not award any contract to a company he has interest in. 

2. Tunji-Ojo is the Minister of Interior and the company in question won a consultancy contract duly advertised and implemented by Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs.

Therefore; there is no conflict of interest whatsoever.

3. The company in question has been in existence doing business with various governments since 2009.

4. Tunji-Ojo resigned as a Director of the company in 2019 and has not participated in running the affairs of the company since then.

5. The company in question won a contract after following due process as laid down in the Public Procurement Act just like every other company that won contracts in the Ministry.

My questions are as follows; 
1. Is there a law that says the company can no longer bid for and win contracts in accordance with Public Procurement Act because it was founded by a minister?

2. Should the company stop doing business or what?

[09/01/2024; 15;28;39] Alfa Gafaru Council; *EXPRESSO_Umbrage》》By Steve Osuji*
 
*DIEZANI; SADIYA AND BETTA*
Interrogating why beautiful women seem worse treasury looters
 
*THE BEAUTIFUL THIEVES*
 Should we make a law urgently that our beautiful women should never be allowed near the national till? Has anyone else noticed the seeming emerging trend of our  women public officials outdoing the men in making a mess of our national treasury?

The womenfolk seem to take no prisoners when they have opportunity to attack and they show exceptional impunity and the  iron balls of hardened pyrates.

In May 2014; this column (then appearing in The Nation newspaper); had described Diezani Alison-Madueke as “the beautiful thief”). Diezani was minister in charge of Petroleum under President Goodluck Jonathan. 

Many of my readers had taken umbrage that I  had crossed the line to pronounce someone under investigation guilty. But I had insisted that monumental circumstantial evidence are sufficient to show that Diezani was (and still is a thief of public fund kept under her care). I argued that reversal of status had occurred which placed the onus and burden on her to prove her innocence. Indeed; Public officials who have become brazen and wanton with our commonwealth must not be allowed to enjoy the privilege of being innocent until proven guilty ... not while we watch them enjoy and dissipate the stolen goodies.

As I noted then (and EFCC investigation reports have emerged since to support my claims); Diezani and her partners-in-crime (mainly Jide Omokore and Kola Aluko) virtually took NNPC’S treasury home and helped themselves to their fill.
While millions of dollars worth of properties have been confiscated from Diezani across Nigeria; she lives in St. John’s Wood in the highbrow area of West London; UK. But here’s the mind bursting news; Diezani has not only bought the citizenship of a little island called Dominican Republic; she is a powerful government minister in the minute country. This must give you an inkling as to how much leeway Diezani had with Nigeria’s resources kept in her care.

That she has not been convicted till today; nine years after and may never be; is because she has enough means to compromise the EFCC; buy judges; suborn British officials and buy a small country of her own.

She even did a evil collabo with a so-called journalist (Dele Momodu); publisher of a rubbish photomag (Ovation) to lie to the world that she was afflicted with a rampaging end-stage breast cancer. The rogue journalist devoted an entire edition  of his trash journal to commit such journalistic infamy never known in the history of journalism. Probably the worst fabrication and public deceit since journalism started! In decent climes Dele Momodu should be serving a long jail term for perjury of the grandest kind. 

*SADIYA UMAR FAROUQ DEPLOYS THE MOMODU-DIEZANI PLAY BOOK*
Today;  another extremely gorgeous woman who has shown herself to suffer acute kleptomania like Diezani; seems to have adopted the Diezani tactics after a looting spree of public funds.
Sadiya was pioneer minister of Humanitarian Affairs; Disaster Management and Social Development. She turned out to be a disaster unto Nigerians in dire situations who desperately needed support from her.

Ensconced in a new ministry made especially for her and regardless that she was unsuitable for the job; she took utmost liberty with the funds; keeping a chunk of it for herself. 

Like Diezani;  her impunity knew no bounds knowing that her boss;  Number One; lived under her skirt; in a manner of speaking. Again;  like Diezani;  she shunned the National Assembly and treated them with disdain.

Today;  like Diezani;  she pleads ailment upon the slightest scrutiny of her tour of duty which has let off a stench that’s already suffocating the country. 

*BETTA EDU*
Another banal beauty; she has only assumed office for about three month; replacing Hajia Sadiya and she has shown her ugly side so quick. She was already on a looting  spree and had to be sacked; thank goodness. Of course;  she didn’t have the requisite experience for the job.

*ARE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN WORSE LOOTERS*
Remember we are trying to interrogate the notion that beautiful women in public office are more given to corruption. EXPRESSO is not a psychoanalyst or psychologist at that but let’s try deducing some experiential and commonsensical reason why good looking women would turn out ugly in the Nigeria public work milieu.

First; beauty enthrals. Beauty enchants. Beauty excites. And let’s agree firstly that the most beautiful thing God made  is a beautiful woman. A physically beautiful woman enthrals; enchants; excites and indeed;  mesmerises. 

It is a  common knowledge that feminine beauty plus the wiles of womanity arrayed against the male counterpart in a work environment would produce the most deleterious effect. Remember the power of Delilah on Samson; Esther against king Ahaseurus and Jezebel's vice grip on Ahab. Our own weird intellectual; Chiweizu devoted a book to the power of female anatomy.

*JONATHAN’S DIEZANI COMPLEX*
Diezani was beautiful to the extreme.  From the face of it that is. She was also from a well- heeled Port Harcourt family. Story was told of how former President Goodluck (I had no shoes) Jonathan couldn’t stand quite erect before Diezani in their hay days in Port Harcourt. 

Diezani was to rise to be a director in Shell Petroleum;  marry a navy General and become Minister for Transportation under the Umaru Yar’Adua administration. When Jonathan took over from  Yar’Adua; he already suffered what may be described as the Diezani complex. 

Jonathan made her Petroleum Minister; the first Nigerian female to get  that plum portfolio. Stories wafting out of Aso Rock was that Diezani could have gotten any half the kingdom if she wanted because Jonathan was still besotted to her. But no position is bigger or better than the oil minister’s seat anyways. 

It was said that; just like Delilah twisted Samson like a thread; and made him look ludicrous; so Diezani had Jonathan under her armpit. She would crumple and throw into the trashcan; written notes from President Jonathan right before the bearer.

She ran the oil ministry/NNPC like her private estate. As the days went by she got utterly reckless and out of control. The only thorn in  her flesh was Mrs Patience Jonathan; the first lady; who could no longer bear the vice grip she had on the president. 

There was also the Aviation Minister; Stella Oduah. They were members of Jonathan’s
‘otherroom' cabinet and they wielded undue influence in the affairs of Nigeria those days. When therefore  people ask; where was President Jonathan when Diezani was recklessly looting the treasury? now you know.

*SADIYA AS BUHARI’S MISTRESS*
The rift between President Muhammadu Buhari and his young wife Aisha was burst forth into the open early in the first term. It was so bad that the president deploying his Aso Rock cabal (Abba Kyari; Mamman Daura; Isa Funtua and Saibu ‘Tunde' Yusuf) to keep first lady Aisha out of the power loop.

The first lady sought a safe haven in Dubai where she lived for most of Buhari’s time. But during one long absence;  the cabal almost wedded Sadiya Farouq to the president forcing Aisha to rush home at the nick of time to abort the plan. 

It was after this episode that the honeypot known as Humanitarian Affairs... ministry was created. It was actually conduit for the cabals to feather their nests. This explains why Sadiya acted with uncommon impunity.

*BETTER EDU AND THE OLYMPOTIC FELLOW*
This young woman was former Governor Ben Ayade's ‘project’. An ravishing lady barely out of school; Ayade took her for his prize and ensconced her to heights that were too dizzying for her age and wisdom. Lost in her bewitching beauty; he didn’t stop at making her a ‘star’ in Cross River State; Ayade; himself a woeful Governor pushed Betta to President Bola Tinubu as his ministerial nominee of all the quality minds Cross River State. 

In Abuja; the new Aso Rock cabal came under the spell of her beauty and put her on the ministry specially created for beautiful women. And alas; Betta Edu followed  the footprints left in that office by Hajia Sadiya.

*THE TOXIC POWERS OF FEMININE BEAUTY*
A colleague and former president of the Nigerian Guild of Editors; Funke Egbemode once noted  in her column to the effect that; very few men can be normal before a woman especially if he’s peeking down her plunging cleavage... most honest men would agree to what I what to hold up as Funke's Dictum. 

From the boardroom to the shop floor; a beautiful woman imbued with ample feminine guiles would have her way in any office politics or a jostle for advantage. And let’s extrapolate that a beautiful woman who is quick to take advantage of her looks to win favours would use the same weapon to attack the treasury. 

*THE EVIL OF SELF WORSHIP*
Beautiful women are victims of selfism. They would make themselves into ungraven image for self worship. Since they are lost to themselves; they are not  given to much high values or any moral high grounds. They suffer the Imelda complex. 

The one time first lady of the Philippines; Imelda Marcos was a former beauty queen before she became wife of the president. History remembers her today for having 3000 shoes among other outlandish numbers of fur coats; jewellery;  etc. 

Diezani had some lavish set of jewellery too. Most women would splurge on vanity but wealthy beauties are bound to outdo themselves. 

*NEVER GIVE ABSOLUTE POWER TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN*
Finally; this column hereby moves the motion that we should never give power and high level access to unduly beautiful women... for our sanity sake! 

*CAVEAT*
Well; please let no one ask me who is a beautiful woman!

[09/01/2024; 18;49;50] ; EASY LIFE VENTURES; AFTER SEX WHAT NEXT?

It's possible for any man to ask for sex in a relationship; but is left for you as a lady to know that sex; can't keep him..(Sex isn't enough)

There are two major factors ladies complain about sex in a relationship;
(1) After giving him my body he left me..
(2)He left because I refused to have sex with him..

NOTE; Both those who gave and those who refused to give are complaining...
( Whats the difference)

Ladies Listen; Sex isn't enough; its not the only thing you can offer a man.
If You Don't Have Anything To Offer A Man Outside Sex; Please remain Single...

A man can't stay with you because his having sex with you....

Relationship is not buying and selling.
There are much to life than Monkey style; Doggy style; Missionary style; Apple n juice style; step pillows style; etc ...

Are you sound intellectually? Spiritually? Physically? Mentally? Emotionally?

Men love intelligent ladies...
Men love ladies with ideas..
Men love respectful ladies...
Men respect ladies that know what domestic work is
Men love and appreciate a woman who is good and excellent in multi-tasking
Men respect and honor ladies that wakes up very early in the morning to make sure that the kitchen is set.
Men respect ladies that keep their eyes at home than those that their eyes are always outside 
Men love bravo ladies

Sex is very cheap these days; anybody can buy it.

 You need to build yourself beyond sex.
Leave make-ups and be a productive lady.
Men are looking for ladies with ideas and solution not those who paint their faces with different colours.

*What a man wants is beauty with brain not make ups with boobs or hips. Because all these will fail but what you have upstairs will remain.

Your husband complains because you think that you know it but you don't know it. Just do what your own husband wants and not what men want. Hope it help our generations

Jaiz banks
-over alleged fraud.

The affected CEOs are 
Dr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu (Zenith Bank)
Haruna Musa (Jaiz Bank); and 
Walter Akpani (Providus Bank).

Sources close to The Guardian who confirmed the development on condition of anonymity said the arrests was made on Tuesday.

According to the source; the banking executives; long suspected of facilitating the improper diversion of public funds into private accounts; are now facing the music within the confines of EFCC custody.

The anti-graft agency is dissecting a web of suspicious transactions involving hefty sums of public money funnelled into private accounts; allegedly approved by Edu and Farouq leveraging their ministerial positions.

*4 MYTHS VANQUISHED within 4months*

*MYTH1*; ```If we put educated people in government;  Nigeria will transform. Beta was America-trained.```

*MYTH 2*; ```if we put women in power; Nigeria will develop; Beta is a she.```

*MYTH 3* ```If we put young people in government; things will change; Beta is under 40 years```

*MYTH 4*; ```If we put professionals in power; Nigeria will be better; Beta is a professional and she did wonders in 4 months.```

*In 4 months; Beta Edu shattered the 4 myths completely*

```Nigeria; as presently constituted; is ungovernable because it is a body without a soul or spirit.

 It is perceived as a``` *Dying Whale and every one brings their own cleaver for chopping the salty meat of the helpless Whale*

 ```Beta Edu is just one of the numerous butchers; only that she was too much in a hurry; behaving like a thirsty person who has not taken water for days.

Our challenges are fundamental; retail approach will not work; It needs a comprehensive overhauling.

I understand some people spent between N200m- N500m to get a Ministerial position.
 So what do you expect when you make an investment; with borrowed money? Profit; of course

The System is too expensive; too complicated and crippled  by corruption; so it is impossible to walk and work.```

[10/01/2024; 19;52;16] Alfa Gafaru Council; *BOOM* 💥 *BOOM*

*LET NO ONE THINK A MAN IS BEHIND WHAT DR.BETTA EDU DID.*

*SOME FACTS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MINISTRY OF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS & DR.BETTA EDU.* 

*Halima;the next main person to Betta realised that Betta Edu; the Minister has moved huge Billions into her personal accounts from the ministry's account and she still had pending transactions to be moved.*

*So Halima moved the remaining ₦32 billion into 3(three) other accounts belonging to the Ministry and she informed few top officials in the ministry about what she can do to stop Betta from looting the whole money from that particular account.*

*When Betta found out the remaining money wasn't in the account when she wanted to move more; she called Halima and questioned her since she is the next main person who has access to that particular account.*

*Halima refused to tell Betta where the funds were moved to;Betta then reported to EFCC that Halima had stolen money from the Ministry.*

*Upon Halima's arrest; she showed EFCC the 3(three) accounts where she moved the money to and the money was intact.*

*She also gave them proof of how Betta had already stolen huge billions from the account and evidences of pending transactions for her to move more.*

*She also mentioned how she had already informed some top officials via texts etc of how she was moving the ₦32billion into other accounts belonging to the Ministry where it will take time for Betta to access and also use that as a means to blow Betta's cover up on how she's being stealing.*

*Inside information has it that Betta is really connected and cunning and the only way Halima could stop her was to put in measures so this will go public and also find a way for it to get to the President before Betta uses her connections to stop it from getting to the President.*

*So as EFCC was invited into the case by Betta; she didn't know Halima only moved the money into other accounts belonging to the ministry.*

*She also didn't know it was more of a trap to stop her from looting more.*

*When EFCC was called into the matter; Halima still refused to disclosed to where the money was until after EFCC sent their report to Mr President .*

*By then the President has already been made aware of it so it was too late for anyone to keep any information away from him.*

*ANYONE THAT ANNOYS YOU* --is teaching you patience and calmness.

*ANYBODY THAT OFFENDS YOU* --is teaching you forgiveness and compassion.

*ANYTHING THAT YOU HATE* --is teaching you; unconditional love.

Always look out for the lesson in every situation you face in every phase of life.
Be polite; calm; gentle and thankful to God because He will be with you to the end.
Life had taught me lessons. I do not see people at my cross road; because humans are not reliable.  I only see God as the author and finisher of my faith.

*R E F L E C T I O N S*
*When you live your life without anyone betraying; hurting; disappointing; disgracing or offending you; then it means you never did anything worthy.* 

*The beauty of life; is that it comes with disappointments and betrayals; from people you least expect.*

*Unfortunately; some of us spend so much time crying over these betrayals and disappointments; and end up becoming victims of all circumstances.* 

 *Remember One Thing;* *Holding unto anger is like knocking your head on the wall and expecting the other person to feel the pain. You are only hurting yourself.*

*The fact is that the world is full of annoying; naughty; stupid and ungrateful people; and you will always come across them at one point or another in life. But the best thing to do; is to deal with them with wisdom and maturity.*

*You can’t get everyone to love you; think like you or behave like you... never.*

*We must learn to tolerate and overlook certain things; we must try to bury the faults of others and move on with life.* 

*Anger; Hatred and Intolerance have caused most of the world's problems and solved none.*

*Life is short; you don't know how much time you have left* 

*I beseech you to take the pain and forgive that special person you hold grudges against; and iron out your grievances.* 

*Muster the courage and apologise to that person you have offended.* 

*Life is not measured by the amount of money; houses or companies you have; but by the positive impact you have made in the  lives of others.* 

REMAIN BLESSED 🙏🏿❤️

[11/01/2024; 12;18;17] ; femiOJO; The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has issued a warning about the potential dangers of the popular catchphrase 'no gree for anybody'; widely used by the youths. The slogan; which has gone viral on social media and become a humorous motto for 2024; essentially means not tolerating nonsense or bullying from anyone. During a press briefing; the force spokesperson; Muyiwa Adejobi; expressed concerns based on intelligence reports. He indicated that the phrase; while seemingly innocuous; is viewed by security officials as dangerous and could potentially lead to significant crises across the country.

[11/01/2024; 16;49;43] ; femiOJO; Those who knew the number of times PDP invited Tinubu to join them when he was the only surviving AD governor won't say that all politicians lack principle.

It is an aberration to so conclude. 

I know some politicians in Oyo state who did not get an office because they refused the conditions given them by late Lamidi Adedibu to get his support.

But I also know how Peter Obi wanted to become the SGF under Jonathan which made him leave APuGA for PDP after completing his second term as the governor of Anambra state. He couldn't get Obiano to follow him.

Iroko did same and he has since lost his relevance in Ondo politics. I am telling you the truth.

If you don't know a thing; farabale and learn. Nobody knows it all. It is not all politicians that are shameless. It is not all of them that lack principle and ideological belief.

Tinubu who was the only AD governor out of 36 governors then but who refused all entrities from the then all powerful and all conquering PDP is today the President based on his unbending principle while those who danced around like yoyo in well documented unprincipled manner are well below him.

 Sir; I was in JBN when Third Mainland bridge was been constructed by the Consortium of Julius Berger and PGH; PGH are working from Èbúté Metta axis of the bridge with their yard closed to Oko Baba and Julius Berger from Oworonshoki Bariga end; Engr; Anibaba was the representative of the ministry of Works then and I could remembered vividly that when it was time to join the Bridge together almost at the middle; it was a hell; our Project Manager then was Mr Goebel or Mr Schneider; not until two German guy came in in  an airport shuttle and dive straight to the lagoon with an empty bottle in their hand and in about 7;8 or 10 minutes they came out with content that looks like imps in the bottle; the waiting Airport Shuttle picked  them immediately and straight to Muritala; that was the week the bridge was joined together. This wasn't done in the night; it was in the day time. I was lucky to witnessed this may be because of my inquisitiveness or whatever.
So this sacrifice been made shouldn't be strange to us as far as 3rd mainland is concerned.

[11/01/2024; 18;40;21] Alfa Gafaru Council; PRESS RELEASE

*APC PROFESSIONALS FORUM COMMENDS PRESIDENT TINUBU ON SWIFT HOUSE-CLEANING; ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES*

 
The APC Professionals Forum commends President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his swift action in suspending his appointees whose actions in office have been found questionable in the course of discharging their duties. 

His decision has renewed the hope of majority of Nigerians in the fight against corruption and malpractice in public offices.  

It is our considered opinion that the move further re-emphasized the importance President Tinubu has placed on integrity coming few months after he introduced KPIs for his appointees in order to ensure optimal performance .  

With this; we are quite optimistic that a strong signal has been sent to public officials to focus on democratic deliverables as promised in the Renewed Hope agenda and not to be distracted by frivolities that could embarrass the President Tinubu-led administration and our great party; the All Progressives Congress (APC).

We are also glad that the President has acceded to our position on cost of governance by slashing expenditure on all foreign and domestic trips by all officials of his administration including himself.

This is not only commendable but also a good way of leading by example. We look forward to more.

We however urge the government to continuously recruit progressive minded; loyal party members as well as thorough bred professionals with high standard of ethics into other positions yet to be filled by the administration.

Signed

[12/01/2024; 16;50;41] ; FORTUNE 2024 GREETINGS; EFCC summons 20 directors; others from ministry of Humanitarian Affairs

January 12; 2024


As a follow-up to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation probe; the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has summoned 20 senior directors and officials of the ministry.



Some of the officials; The PUNCH reports; were questioned by investigators at the EFCC headquarters on Thursday.

This latest development followed a detailed investigation report on the ministry and recommendations presented by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission to the EFCC on Tuesday.

A source; who confided in one of PUNCH correspondents on Thursday; said; “The EFCC is also probing some officials in the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs. Some director-generals and civil servants; about 20 of them; are being interrogated. Some have been quizzed; and more are still coming for interrogation as the investigation continues.”

Another source further revealed that the probe had been widened to uncover various financial improprieties that might have been carried out since the ministry was created in 2019.

The source stated; “The fraud that was carried out in the ministry is very massive. It spans several projects and programmes executed over the past years from the immediate past administration into the new administration. Also; ex-minister Sadiya; Betta Edu; and Halima Shehu are not the only ones being quizzed. Several civil servants and ministry officials were involved too.”

Findings indicate that the collaboration between the EFCC and the ICPC would expect to expose more financial misconduct and other mischief perpetrated by civil servants since the Buhari administration period.

It had been reported how the ICPC intercepted and recovered N50bn from the humanitarian affairs ministry between July and August 2023 during Sadiya Umar-Farouq
tenure.

The money; which was about to be embezzled; was recovered by the ICPC and paid into the Central Bank of Nigeria.

Some officials had attempted to transfer the N50bn into private bank accounts but it was intercepted and recovered by the ICPC under its former Chairman; Bolaji Owasanoye.

In the spirit of synergy and to deepen the ongoing probe of the humanitarian affairs ministry; the ICPC chairman; Musa Aliyu; SAN; presented its investigation report to the EFCC chairman; Ola Olukoyede; at a meeting held at the EFCC headquarters.

The meeting had in attendance the chairmen and management staff of the two anti-graft agencies. It was aimed at deepening the cooperation and synergising efforts for greater impact in Nigeria’s anti-corruption drive.

The collaboration between the two agencies; Aliyu said; was to strengthen the nation’s fight against corruption; adding that the visit to the EFCC was a show of commitment to the existing relationship between the two agencies.

He expressed the readiness of the ICPC under his leadership to provide the needed support and cooperation in the interest of eradicating corruption in Nigeria.

“We need to work together; and we cannot do this without a good relationship. That’s why I think I need to extend this hand of friendship to the EFCC so that we can effectively partner in the fight against corruption in Nigeria;” he said.

“I am aware that there’s an MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) between the EFCC and ICPC. I’m willing and ready to partner whenever there’s any issue of interest in the fight against corruption.

“I’ll be reaching out to my brother and chairman of EFCC on issues I think we can partner with because there’s no need for us to be duplicating responsibilities; wasting resources and time. I hope with this first meeting; we are going to be meeting regularly to review what we are doing together;’’ he noted.

On his part; Olukoyede concurred with the position of collaboration; saying the meeting had also presented an opportunity for the review of the existing MoU between the two agencies.

“We have areas of similar mandates and with a population of about 250 million people; there’s so much in our hands and I can tell you that the enormity of the work demands that we work together;’’ he noted.

The EFCC boss also said that the political will of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to fight corruption; as demonstrated in recent events; was enough boost for anti-corruption agencies to give their best.

Sources said the ICPC report detailed the various roles played by several officials in the aborted move to divert the N50bn belonging to the National Social Investment Programme Agency and other infractions.

The report is expected to assist the EFCC in its investigation of the suspended humanitarian affairs minister; Betta Edu; ex-minister Sadiya Umar-Farouq; and Ms Halima Shehu; the suspended National Coordinator and CEO of the National Social Investment Programme; an agency under the humanitarian ministry.

Edu is being investigated for authorizing the transfer of N585m into the private account of an accountant in the ministry; Bridget Oniyelu while Umar-Farouq; who served as a minister under former President Muhammadu Buhari; is answering tough questions over alleged N37bn money laundering.

Halima Shehu on the other hand is under probe for allegedly moving N44bn NSIP funds into some private and corporate accounts without presidential approval.


Edu; who was suspended by President Bola Tinubu on Monday; had claimed that the N585m payment was meant for vulnerable groups in Akwa Ibom; Cross River; Ogun; and Lagos states.

In her defence; her Media Assistant; Rasheed Olarewaju; argued it was legal within the civil service for such payments to be made into private accounts of staff members; especially project accountants.

But the Accountant-General of the Federation; Dr Oluwatoyin Madein; said she did not honour the request to pay N585m into the private account; adding that the minister was rather advised on the appropriate steps to take in making such payments in line with the established payment procedure.

 … As Lagos Produces List of 283;003 Beneficiaries of N25;000 For Three Months 

The Federal and the Lagos State Governments are currently perfecting arrangements to commence the disbursing of N25;000 for three months to 283;003 vulnerable households identified in Lagos State under the Renewed Hope Cash Transfer programme launched by the Federal Government in 2023. 

Ahead of the commencement of the disbursement of the support funds; an enrollment training exercise that will aid the capacity-building of the nominated 186 Cash Transfer Facilitators (CTFs) and equip them for the task took place in Lagos on Tuesday at Ostrall Hall; Ikeja. 

Speaking during the training programme; the Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment in Lagos State; Hon. Akinyemi Ajigbotafe informed that the initiative was part of efforts of the Federal Government to mitigate the economic shocks arising from Government's Policies; Natural Disasters; or Pandemics that negatively affected rural and urban livelihoods in Nigeria. 

According to him; the Federal Government established a time-limited Economic Shock Response – Cash Transfers (ESR-CT) of N25;000 for three months to 283;003 Poor and Vulnerable Households (PVHHs) in Lagos State to cushion the effect of the ongoing economic reforms at the Federal level. He urged the Cash Transfer Facilitators (CTFs); to see themselves as grassroots mobilizers; foot soldiers; and ambassadors of the State of Excellence; who must discharge their duties as expected without fear or favour to anyone.

of Wealth Creation and Employment; has been assigned to implement Renewed Hope Cash Transfer to 283;000 beneficiaries in the 57 LGs/LCDAs across Lagos state.

 “As part of the Institutional Arrangement; the Cash Transfer Facilitators are drawn from the Local Governments and Local Council Development Areas of the wards where the targeted beneficiaries were validated”; the Permanent Secretary added.

(additional info.; Oba Gbadebo I trip to London on his state visit to King Edward II)

Narration; The Egba; a Yoruba group; currently resides in the central regions of Ogun State in southwestern Nigeria. In 1830; they sought refuge and settled in Abeokuta; maintaining formal independence from British rule until 1914. 

The Egba are organized into the provinces of Ake; Gbagura; Oke-Ona; and Owu; each led by an oba (king) known as Alake; Agura; Osile; and Olowu; respectively. Political power before 1914 was decentralized; with governance extending to townships and divided among war chiefs; civil chiefs; hunters; and trade chiefs.

Historically; the Egba has been seen as an example of "aborted modernization" in West Africa. Proximity to Lagos made them significant to British consuls and merchants; attracting early missionary attention. 

The Egba's unique institutional development was highlighted in their testimony to the West African Lands Committee in 1913; emphasizing the long-standing custom of outright land sale; a practice more prevalent in Egba territory compared to other Yoruba provinces.

1830-1914 by JAMES FENSKE"

Life often deals to each and everyone of us the way we approach it. To the simple life is simple; To the non challant nothing matters in life; To the commited and serious one; Everything in life should be faced; approached and tackled with all seriousness. We must learn to shape our perception of how we see ourselves and life; With ordinary talent and extraordinary perseverance; all things are attainable.Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after another which we have to be consistent with. We have a choice; We can either give in and relent; or we can refuse to quit and just keep on  fighting. We must Persevere in order to win  and create a life worth of living. For us quitting is not an option; success is our goal and vision. We are the result of preparation; hard work and learning from failure.As we Listen; persevere and Focus on the present; We move away and never dwell on the past and the negativities around us. We go with confidence and with a mind set of success.

PRESIDENT TINUBU ESTABLISHES SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL PANEL ON SOCIAL INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES

Sequel to President Bola Tinubu's six-week suspension of the four (4) programmes under the National Social Investment Programmes Agency (NSIPA); President Tinubu has approved the establishment of a Special Presidential Panel; which will be led by the Coordinating Minister of the Economy and Honourable Minister of Finance; Mr. Wale Edun.

This Special Presidential Panel is tasked with immediately undertaking a comprehensive review and audit of existing financial frameworks and policy guidelines of the social investment programmes with a view to implementing a total re-engineering of the financial architecture of the programmes with detailed modification to procedures guiding the programmes' implementation moving forward.

The Special Presidential Panel; which is comprised of ministers representing strategic sectors and will ensure a multi-disciplinary approach to the reform effort; is made up of the following members;

(1) Coordinating Minister of the Economy and Minister of Finance - Chairman

(2) Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare - Member

(3) Honourable Minister of Budget and Economic Planning - Member

(4) Honourable Minister of Information and National Orientation - Member

(5) Honourable Minister of Communicatons; Innovation and Digital Economy - Member

(6) Honourable Minister of State for Youth - Member

President Tinubu anticipates that this Special Presidential Panel will validate the confidence reposed in it by winning back all lost public confidence in these vital programmes over the years by ushering in a new era of operation based on open and accountable governance frameworks that will prove impervious to abuse and incompetence for the exclusive benefit of disadvantaged households across our nation.

*PRESIDENT TINUBU ESTABLISHES SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL PANEL ON SOCIAL INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES*

Sequel to President Bola Tinubu's six-week suspension of the four (4) programmes under the National Social Investment Programmes Agency (NSIPA); President Tinubu has approved the establishment of a Special Presidential Panel; which will be led by the Coordinating Minister of the Economy and Honourable Minister of Finance; Mr. Wale Edun.

This Special Presidential Panel is tasked with immediately undertaking a comprehensive review and audit of existing financial frameworks and policy guidelines of the social investment programmes with a view to implementing a total re-engineering of the financial architecture of the programmes with detailed modification to procedures guiding the programmes' implementation moving forward.

The Special Presidential Panel; which is comprised of ministers representing strategic sectors and will ensure a multi-disciplinary approach to the reform effort; is made up of the following members;

(1) Coordinating Minister of the Economy and Minister of Finance - Chairman

(2) Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare - Member

(3) Honourable Minister of Budget and Economic Planning - Member

(4) Honourable Minister of Information and National Orientation - Member

(5) Honourable Minister of Communicatons; Innovation and Digital Economy - Member

(6) Honourable Minister of State for Youth - Member

President Tinubu anticipates that this Special Presidential Panel will validate the confidence reposed in it by winning back all lost public confidence in these vital programmes over the years by ushering in a new era of operation based on open and accountable governance frameworks that will prove impervious to abuse and incompetence for the exclusive benefit of disadvantaged households across our nation.

CBN decongests head office; moves departments to Lagos

The Central Bank of Nigeria is set to transfer some of its departments to Lagos State.
[13/01/2024; 22;26;32] ; omoleader7; *Nigerians have no reason to be poor; according to President Bola Tinubu on Friday.*

At the Presidential Villa in Abuja; he made this request of governors chosen on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform; asking them to create and carry out policies that prioritize all Nigerians and always put the interests of the country before those of political affiliations.

“We don’t need to live in poverty.” Looking back on our past and present; we can see why we are experiencing structural decay; a lack of high-quality; all-inclusive education; and inadequate medical facilities. The President’s media aide; Ajuri Ngelale; cited him as saying; “We are not a cursed country; but blessed.”

Read more about Tinubu’s suspension of the national social investment program.

He explained to the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) that while division is one of the country’s biggest problems; the ruling party must work to heal and unify the nation by establishing a shared national vision and allocating resources to nation-building.

The President asserted that inclusion; ownership; and sustainability are the only conditions under which development policies would fully apply to people’s lives.

Tinubu believes that Nigeria is too endowed with material; human; and natural resources to be experiencing a lack of top-notch healthcare facilities; education; or infrastructure.

People can be converted; they say. People can be persuaded to support you; he said.

He urged the governors to develop a plan to implement the school-feeding program across the federation’s states more widely and successfully; taking into account the uniqueness of each region while aiming to enroll all kids in school.

“We have school-age kids who have dropped out of school.” Including all governors; including those in opposition; in the school-feeding program is the best way to advance education. Take it seriously; please.

The children shouldn’t be treated like statistics. Their return to the classroom should be viewed as a success. Economic growth should be accompanied by increased value and empowerment. To investigate the techniques; a committee should be formed. The President declared; “I’m prepared to invest in school feeding.

[14/01/2024; 07;55;30] BigRhymey🦅💯; *Unleashing Youth* *Support for the Super Eagles in* *the Nations Cup* 

 *Dear Member Organizations/* *Leaders/ Stakeholders NYCN* *Agbado/Oke-Odo Local Branch* ;

I hope this message finds you well. As a proud youth and passionate supporter of our beloved Nigeria Super Eagles; I am writing to express my wholehearted enthusiasm for the upcoming Nations Cup.

In the spirit of unity; I believe it's crucial for us; the youth; to come forward and stand united in support of our national football team. The Super Eagles represent the pride and resilience of our nation; and our backing can serve as a powerful force to motivate and inspire the players.

As the Lagos State Government Led by Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration organized gatherings; in person and virtually; to watch the matches together; cheer for our team; and showcase the unwavering spirit of the Nigerian youth. Whether it's through social media campaigns; local events; or friendly competitions; let's create an atmosphere of fervent support for the Super Eagles.

The Agbado/Oke-Odo LCDA Led administration of our own Chairman Engr. Oladapo David Famuyiwa use this time in Calling on all youth to embrace national pride! 
Join the Chairman and his Executives *today by 2pm* in celebrating unity and passion for our country by coming together to watch the Nations Cup football. Let's cheer for our team and create unforgettable moments of national camaraderie. At the Local Government Secretariat Open ground as gaint screen is placed there for unforgettable watching moments. 

This isn't just about football; it's about fostering a sense of national identity and pride among the youth. Let's celebrate the diversity that makes our country unique and use the Nations Cup as an opportunity to strengthen the bonds that unite us.

I Comrade Oshungboye Obafemi Stephen propose that all members organizations are well represented to make our collective support visible and impactful. Together; we can create a memorable experience and leave an indelible mark on the journey of the Super Eagles in the Nations Cup.

I look forward to your support and collaboration in making this initiative a resounding success.

[14/01/2024; 10;51;21] ; Reformer The Unstoppable; WHAT IS KILLING NIGERIA

*"Say No to Quota System 63 yrs after independence"*
 

*Two kids were born August 31st; 1980; in Kano. Jubril is from Kano as his state of origin while Adewale is of parents from Osun state*

They both attended the same primary school to Primary 6; then the twist began

*They both sat for Federal Common Entrance examination; Adewale scored 188/200 and Jubril 16/200. As a result or the Nigerian quota system; they both ended up in the same class at Federal Government College; Zaria.*

Adewale continued to come 1st-3rd in the class of 35 and Jubril 30-35th/35. 

*6 years later; WASCE and JAMB were taken. Adewale had 6As and 2Cs (WASCE) and 286/400 (JAMB) while Jubril had 5Cs and 2Ps and 106/400 in JAMB*

Again by a warped and weird stroke they end up in the same Law Faculty in Ahmadu Bello University; Zaria. 

*5 years later Adewale graduated with 2-1 and Jibril with a Pass!*

Adewale finished from Law school at Abuja - No Job after NYSC.

*Jubril as soon as he left the Abuja Law school; one year NYSC got a job as a Magistrate at the Federal Magistrate Court Abuja; 2 years later he was promoted as a Judge*

Adewale still struggling; decided to join some Trio of old seniors who operate a Law outfit in Abuja as a junior lawyer.

*5 years later he was still carrying files and coming to defend low level cases at Jubril's court.*

If you love fairness; equity and justice will you want Nigeria to continue like this? 

*That's the problem with Nigeria as it is.*

It's strongly skewed to the advantage of a particular ethnic group in Nigeria.

*Must we allow this to continue?*

The truth be told in all sincerity; the Labour of our heroes past can never be in vain. 

*Adewale finds his way to the Uk; he immediately thrills them with his brilliance and in less than 8 years he becomes a full Professor.*
 
He could achieve his dreams anywhere in the world where hardwork and brilliance is rewarded except in his native Country.

Twenty years down the line; Adewale's children are being celebrated in their adopted country. Jubril is lining up his children to benefit from the same system that favoured him. 

*This really hurts.... Say No to Brain drain; Say No to a system that polarises us; Say No to mediocrity; Say No to any system that will make our children hate the country of their birth; Say no to QUOTA System 63 yrs after independence.*

Nigeria deserves to have her best brains and working for her! 

 *Pass this on to every Nigerian on your contact list....*

[14/01/2024; 12;09;35] ; femiOJO; In 2022; Nigeria spent $23.3 billion on petroleum product imports and consumes around 33 million litres of petrol a day. Dangote's 650;000 barrels per day refinery will produce 53 million litres a day.

The refinery started production yesterday with diesel and aviation fuel.

In coming weeks; it will produce all other products and hit the projected 53 million litres a day. 

What are its most important implications on the economy?

1. Over $20 billion will be free as there won't be a need to import refined products any more. This will reduce grossly; the demand for dollars and therefore strengthen the local currency.

2. Freight cost will be off the price and even though; it won't bring much difference in the price; a difference of even N10 on a litre is significant.

3. Dangote Refinery will have a surplus of 20 million litres for exports after fully meeting the local demand of about 33 million litres and those buyers will pay in foreign currencies as Nigeria is also paying in dollars to bring in the products and this too will bring more dollars into the system and impliedly give the naira some strength.

4. The availability of dollars in the economy as a result of this singular investment will allow the Central Bank of Nigeria fulfill its payment obligations to international airlines and other foreign business operators in the country and this will boost foreign investment trust in the Nigerian economy which will lead to job and wealth creation.

5. The success of this refinery will encourage others who are interested in building refineries to join Dangote and Bua and American Baker Hughes; a firm that has already formally expressed its readiness to build a refinery in Nigeria.

Please note that OPEC members are bound to sell crude oil at international price so local refineries in Nigeria too will buy at global rate and so the price; after refining it won't fall by half or anything close to that. The advantages are what I have highlighted above but they could even be more.

The relationships you build will be genuine and meaningful. Remember; real connections are formed when you focus on growing as a person and improving yourself. Instead of seeking approval from others or trying to be like someone else; spend your time and energy developing your skills; pursuing your interests; and showing your unique qualities. By doing this; you'll attract people who appreciate you for who you really are and who share your values and goals. Embrace the journey of discovering yourself; and naturally; you'll find the people who are meant to be in your life.

On January 15; 1966; a group of young military officers staged the first coup in Nigeria and the following leaders were killed in that blo+ody coup;
Sir Ahmadu Bello; Premier Northern Region.
Sir Abubakar Tafawa; Nigerian Prime Minister.
Chief Samuel Ladokr Akintola; Premier Western Region.
Chief Festus Okotie-Eboh-Itsekiri; Premier Midwest Region.

The following military officers also paid the ultimate prize in that coup;
Brigadier Samuel Ademulegun
Brigadier Zakariya Maimalari 
Colonel Kur Mohammed
Colonel Ralph Shodeinde
Lt. Colonel Abogo Lagerma
Lt. Colonel James Pam
Lt. Colonel Arthur Unegbe.

It was seen as a coup against the North and therefore led to the counter coup of July 29; 1966 where the Head of State; Gen Aguiyi Ironsi; his host; the fearless Col Adekunle Fajuyi among others were killed. There was no plan to kill Fajuyi but because he refused to release to the coupists the Head of State who was on a visit to the Western Military Governor in Ibadan; he was eliminated too.

Before the counter coup; Aguiyi Ironsi had; through Decree 34 changed the system from federal to unitary system and the regions were changed to provinces. That was the foundation for the system we operate till date.

Yakubu Gowon; who became the Head of State after him splitter the four provinces of North; East; West and Midwest to twelve States as follows;
              State                  Capital 
North-Western State    Sokoto 
North-Eastern state      Maiduguri 
Kano State                     Kano 
North-Central State      Zaria 
Benue-Plateau State    Jos
Kwara State.                   Ilorin

The NNPCL said it is seeking to engage reputable and credible operations and maintenance companies to operate and maintain the Port Harcourt Refining Company.

This; it said; was “to ensure reliability and sustainability towards meeting the nation’s fuel supply and energy security obligations.”

[15/01/2024; 21;23;32] Alfa Gafaru Council; S/Court;  Tinubu's non-Interference Saved Democracy; Rekindled Hope in Judiciary - Sen Marafa  

Zamfara State Coordinator of the Campaign Council of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Senator Kashim Shettima during the 2023 general Ji elections; Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa; has said that the non-interference of the president in the judgment of the Supreme Court on governorship tussles has saved the country's democracy and rekindled hope in the judiciary. 

The Supreme Court had on Friday affirmed the elections of eight governors including Abba Kabir Yusuf (Kano); Caleb Mutfwang (Plateau); Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos); Bala Mohammed (Bauchi); Dauda Lawal (Zamfara); Francis Nwifuru (Ebonyi State); Alex Otti (Abia) and Bassey Otu (Cross).

Senator Marafa; in a statement he signed and issued in Abuja; on Monday; said President Tinubu and the justices of the apex court have lived up to the expectations of Nigerians; saying posterity will judge them well for allowing the will of the Nigerian voters to prevail.

He commended the president;  who according to the Governor of Kano State; stood his grounds not to interfere with judicial processes despite all pressures to do so by party loyalists.

"It is a welcome development. President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has by this singular action of non-interference in the Supreme Court judgement saved the country's democracy and forestalled the repeat of the 1983 scenario. You will recall that it was after the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) grabbed states that were hitherto of the opposition that the Second Republic collapsed;" he said.

Hailing the justices of the Supreme Court; Sen Marafa said they have lived up to the expectations of the Nigerian masses; adding that they have made the country proud and have written their names in gold.

Marafa; who represented Zamfara Central Senatorial District between 2011 and 2019; said the outcome of the apex court decision on the governorship elections has reinforced his belief in the ability and capacity of the judiciary to right any wrong in the political evolution.

[15/01/2024; 23;58;32] Alimosho Tv; 5 signs you’re becoming a wiser person; according to psychology  by  Ava Sinclair January 14; 2024.



The reason wisdom often comes with age is because it doesn’t happen overnight.
It’s a lifelong journey that involves personal growth and self-reflection.
That’s how we gain important insights; learn from our experiences; and develop a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.
So how do you know it is happening?
Psychology can point us in the right direction.
Here are some surefire signs you’re becoming a wiser person.

1) You’re more open to new experiences and ideas than you once were
When I was younger I used to think I knew it all.
As I got older; and hopefully wiser; I started to see how limited my knowledge and experiences truly were.
Get updates on the latest posts and more from Hack Spirit straight to your inbox.
I came to realize that in reality; I know very little. But rather than feel disappointed by this; I recognized it was progress.
As  Philip Stanhope; 4th Earl of Chesterfield once put it;
“In seeking wisdom thou art wise; in imagining that thou hast attained it – thou art a fool.”

°The science backs it up.
As explained in ‘Wisdom; The Psychology of Wise Thoughts; Words; and Deeds’ this openness is one of the hallmarks of wisdom.
It makes sense. We get smarter through our ability to learn and absorb more — more information; more ideas; more experiences.
Keeping yourself open to this possibility means you leave the door open for greater wisdom.


2) You tend to think of others and not just yourself
It’s often assumed that as people we can be quite naturally self-absorbed.
This was the view taken by science writer Richard Dawkins; in ‘The Selfish Gene’ who argued that evolutionary psychology has made us this way as we fight to compete.
But more contemporary evidence paints a very different picture. It highlights that humans aren’t inherently selfish; in fact; we’re hardwired to work together.
Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Leeds Beckett University; Steve Taylor; points out in The Conversation;

“It makes more sense then to see traits such as cooperation; egalitarianism; altruism and peacefulness as natural to human beings. These were the traits that have been prevalent in human life for tens of thousands of years. So presumably these traits are still strong in us now.”

Research has also shown that the wisest amongst us “care more than other people about self-direction and a common good.”

That means If you are able to put aside your own selfish desires and think of others; you’re growing as a person.


3) You’re much better at dealing with change
Adaptability has been found to be key in wisdom.
According to the “balance theory of wisdom;” wise people can adapt to new environments; change their environments; or select new environments.
Not only that; but there’s evidence that actively seeking change may make you wiser.
One study of women in midlife found that those who’d made some major shifts in areas like love and work were more likely to be wiser by this stage of their life.
As the saying goes; you live; you learn.
Shaking things up most likely provides more learning opportunities than staying small and safe.
Wisdom also involves recognizing that life is full of uncertainty and trying to become comfortable with that fact.
People on the path to wisdom understand that they cannot control everything and they try to stay open to the new possibilities that change can welcome.
This flexibility allows them to adapt to change and navigate challenges more effortlessly. That’s crucial; as we’re about to see next.


4) You’ve had some struggles along the way; but you coped
Leading an entirely charmed life may sound wonderful; but it’s not the way to wisdom.
As our previous points highlighted; the way we develop as people is by getting out into the world and experiencing it.
We may not like them; but often the negative events that touch our lives give us the greatest opportunity for growth and insight.
The struggles you overcome make you wiser.
This is another thing that research has backed up. Stressful life events can facilitate the development of wisdom.
But only up to a point. If your life holds far more bad than good times; this can inhibit wisdom. 
It not only depends on the extent of our troubles but also how well we respond to them.
If you have taken some knocks in life; but still managed to come out the other side with a generally positive outlook — rest assured it’s made you wiser.


5) You seek out meaning and purpose in life
This is not only the definition of wisdom; it’s also a fundamental key to happiness itself.
One study explained wisdom as our expertise in the meaning of life.
According to this psychological theory; a wise person is someone who understands what is most important and knows how to get it. 
It’s certainly true that so much of our discontentment seems to spring from constantly searching for “more” to make us feel happier. But we can often look in the wrong places.
We may think money; status; or accolades will make us more satisfied; but that’s not the case. The real secret is to find out what matters most to you; and then be proactive in cultivating it.
That could be meaningful relationships; finding purposeful work; making a contribution to society; and asking all of those bigger questions about why we are here.
…Or most likely all of the above.
The point is that you’ve taken the time and energy to really consider what is the meaning of life and how you want to spend your time here on earth.
You may not have all the answers yet; but the very fact you’re searching for them is a testament to your growing wisdom.
The way to wisdom is through greater self-awareness and inquiry
In many ways; wisdom hinges on gaining a deeper understanding.
As Confucius once remarked;
“The beginning of wisdom is the ability to call things by their right names.“
It’s so easy for us to be biased and distorted in our view of ourselves and the world around us. It takes work to gain a better understanding so that we can see things more clearly.
That’s why cultivating self-awareness helps us to get to grips with our own thoughts; emotions; strengths; and limitations.
That’s also going to offer us the emotional intelligence that helps us manage our emotions; as well as empathize with others.
Meanwhile; as well as looking inwards; we have to look outwards.
We need to become like sponges to all the varied experiences and information that life will allow us to absorb.

The states in question are Bauchi; Bayelsa; Benue; Borno; Cross River; Ebonyi; Edo; Gombe; Imo; Jigawa; Nasarawa; Taraba; Yobe; and Zamfara. Between 2021 and the third quarter of 2023; these states failed to attract any of the $14.85bn that foreign investors channelled into Nigeria.

Between 2021 and 2023; Bauchi spent N3.81bn on foreign trips without having anything to show for it. 

Bauchi spent   N3.81bn

Bayelsa spent N1.99bn.

Benue spent N1.33bn.

Borno spent N1.73bn.

Cross River spent N663.16m.

Ebonyi spent N1.01bn.

Edo spent N1.77bn.

Imo spent N541.23m.

Jigawa spent N1.10bn.

Nasarawa spent N541.26m.

Taraba spent N2.52bn.

Yobe spent N1.24bn.

Zamfara spent N2.77bn.

The figures for foreign trips were extracted from state budget performance reports sourced from Open Nigerian States. Many of the states didn’t have their full budget performance reports with some only having for two quarters in some instances.

 *N - egotiate* for something moderate don't copy others who pay heavily for same quality and quantity. No competition In life.

 *U - nderstand* the economy and plan ahead of time because you can't predict another economic meltdown in a country where almost everybody want to steal.

 *A - void* the temptation of men or women; friends; relatives; who have the habit of lavishing your resources. 

 *R - educe* the number of days you fuel your generator. At least feel the pains of others who don't have one. It makes you appreciate God's blessings and his supply.

 *Y - ou* should be wise/careful the way you take loan; always learn to be contented with what you have.

[16/01/2024; 21;57;53] Alfa Gafaru Council; *TEXT OF REMARKS BY PRESIDENT BOLA TINUBU AT THE EVENT TO CELEBRATE CHIEF BISI AKANDE’S 85TH BIRTHDAY IN IBADAN*
 
 It is my joy today to witness the 85th birthday of our own Chief Bisi Akande; the grand old man and one of the moving forces of progressive movement in Nigeria. 

It is delightful and gratifying to know that Chief Akande is still fit; mentally alert; in good health; and continues to contribute meaningfully; in our quest for a fairer; more just and equitable society. 

Baba Akande turning 85 is a landmark achievement that calls for celebration. We must also be thankful to God for his life and for giving the nation an eminent leader like him.
 
He remains one of our respected elder statesmen in Nigeria who continues to offer rare insights and counsel on how best to organise our country for effective governance. 

I have benefited immensely from Baba Akande's good knowledge and perspectives on a wide range of issues as they affect Nigeria and the  Western part of the country. 

As an astute politician; Chief Akande has been part of every political epoch in our country since the Second Republic. He was one of the eminent Nigerians that drafted the 1979 constitution which the amended 1999 constitution; currently in use; largely mirrors. Beyond his sagely contributions to our national development and political evolution over the decades; the most enduring aspect of  his enviable life is his forthrightness; integrity; reliability and spartan life which he imbibed from his leader; Chief Obafemi Awolowo. All these attributes have served him well in all the positions he had the rare honour to occupy in his  illustrious life. 

Baba Akande is a sharp and brilliant accountant. He was a former Secretary to the State Government and later Deputy Governor of old Oyo State. He dutifully served the people of Osun State as the Governor with tremendous success from 1999 to 2003. 
 
A committed democrat; die-hard progressive; and prudent yet compassionate leader of men; Chief Akande has done much for this country and for the progressive family. He has been a prominent architect of our nation's progressive political parties. 
 
If anyone needs a reliable and dependable compatriot as an ally; Chief Akande is that man anyone can go to battle with. Since we transitioned from the defunct Alliance for Democracy to Action Congress; from Action Congress to  Action Congress of Nigeria and  now the governing All Progressives  Congress; Chief Akande has remained a constant feature. l salute his courage and commitment to democratic and Progressive ideals.
 
Whether in public office or later in life in his capacity as pioneer Chairman of ACN or as Interim Chairman of APC; Chief Akande brought honour and integrity into the discharge of his responsibilities. 
 
He could not have done otherwise. Baba had been sold early in life on those noble values of honesty; integrity; conscience; courage; hard work; perseverance and the importance of a good name among others.
 
Highly principled and perceptive; Baba Akande is  selfless and intensely patriotic. He gave more to others than he gave himself. What he has given to his family; his Osun State; to the Yoruba race; he also gave to this country; the very best.
 
Since Baba enlisted in the Action Group in the First Republic to support the progressive ideals of late Chief Obafemi Awolowo; he has not looked back. He stands today even more committed to those vital and necessary ideals. He is one of the few leaders still around who can be called a true disciple of Chief Awolowo. This is hardly surprising. Chief Akande adored the late Chief Awolowo; reading all his books and interventions on public affairs. Writing on Page 17 of his 2021 book ‘My Participations;’ Baba Akande stated; “It was not surprising that as I was growing up and becoming more knowledgeable; I became totally indoctrinated and began to study Chief Awolowo and his Action Group. I read all his books and vowed to emulate him in self-discipline; fearlessness; dignity; courage and patriotism.”

Like Chief Awolowo; Baba Akande has devoted his public life to engendering a truly democratic; just and egalitarian society where all people are given the opportunity to attain a happy and prosperous life. 

Just as Chief Awolowo did for him; Chief Akande has been a father figure and a  mentor to younger politicians across the country particularly in the South-west. He is a consummate teacher; tolerant and cosmopolitan in outlook and an excellent human being. He is charitable and equally helpful to all who came in contact with him no matter their station in life. 

Because of his characteristics as an exemplary leader and mentor; many call him Baba Awon Omo Ke ke ke; meaning the political father of the younger ones. 

For me; Baba has been a close friend; ally and advisor through the years. 
 
Perhaps; I would not be where I am today as President of this country without the help and support he has given. Many countless other people will also affirm that he has had the same positive effect in their lives as he has in mine. 

 
On this special day that we celebrate his 85th birthday; I join his family; friends and other associates to congratulate and to commend him for his outstanding contributions to democratic governance and to the cause of progressive politics and governance in our country.
 
It is my prayer that God will grant Baba good health and he will continue to remain a fountain of wisdom in our midst. 

Happy 85th birthday to Chief Akande.

Information reaching us from EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) is that the current change in weather / atmosphere across the country is not harmattan; but rather an extreme form of air pollution with dire consequences on human health  

This can be hazardous and lead to ;

1.	Reduced Lung function
2.	Respiratory infection
3.	Inflammation
4.	Oxidative Stress (low level of antioxidants which even creates an imbalance in your body)

Consequently; everyone is being advised to please ;

-	Mask-up (wear nose mask)
-	Stay hydrated (Drink more water)
-	Cover food and water very well to prevent dust from settling on them.
-	Wash fruits very well before eating
-	Stay indoors as much as possible    

This condition may prevail for a considerable period of time.

Let’s take note; adhere strictly; keep our family and friends informed

               *LIFE* 
🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏
                

 *Don't* show everybody your wound; not everybody is holding a bandage. Some are with salt and vinegar to increase your pain.

 *Before* you break your back for those you love; ask yourself how many of them will push the wheel chair 👨🏼‍🦽 for you; when you can no longer walk .

 *Don't* confuse your path with destination. Just because it's stormy now; doesn't mean you aren't headed for sunshine later. Don't lose faith.

 *Everyone* wants to be the sun 🌞 to brighten up someone's life ; but why not be the moon 🌕; to shine on someone's darkest hour? 

 *Life* is full of unfriendly friends. Some people didn't die when arrow 🏹 was in their chest; they died when they saw who threw the arrow.

 *Every* situation in life is temporary. So; when life is good make sure you enjoy and receive it fully. And when life is not so good; remember that it will not last forever and better days are on the way.

 *To* be successful in life... Don't be lazy..and stop thinking that people around you owe you favours.

 *Don't* wait for things to get easier; simple and better. Life will always be complicated. Learn how to be happy right now. Otherwise you'll run out of time.

 *Sometimes* we don't heal; we just moved on with pain

  *It's* your road and yours alone; others may walk it with you; but no one can walk it for you.

  *Stop*  overthinking; whatever is happening is happening for a reason. Learn to accept; evolve and grow with it.

  *Some* dark paths will lead you to the brightest places.

  *The* people in your life should be a source of reducing stress; not causing more of it.

  *There* are two types of pain  in the world; pain that hurts you; and pain that changes you.

  *I'm* a strong person; but do you know what makes me cry? It's when I gave my best but I still feel useless.

  *To* be stumbled once is not a reason to quit; but it's the only reason _for you to become more_ _stronger to struggle the_ _journey of life._ 

 Be Encouraged and Keep the 🔥 burning with great Hope. Good morning.
[18/01/2024; 01;56;28] ; Akinwale Israel; No mining company can blast without the security agencies being involved ; there are steps and process in mining that you cannot skip. The foul play there is giving approval to a quarry close to the city ; ordinary blasting sites and machine sites self is always very far from eachother cos something’s you can blast and some stone will push up like it’s being thrown by machine it will look tiny from up but when it get closer u see how large it is that’s why every worker in the  machine sites are always told to go out of the premises when blasting is about to happen; the distance of the blasting site to the machine site is countless hecters yet you will feel the dynamite vibration . Infact villages that are far self you have to notify the farmers to leave the farm just incase stone shoots up during  the blast to avoid hazards
[18/01/2024; 02;00;41] ; Akinwale Israel; Looking at the document the stone on the site is  tourmaline that’s a crazy expensive gem I guess they don’t know the value until recently .. they would have paid the mining department a fortune to get that approval . It’s above the state government; every approval do come from mining cadastre in Abuja ‎<This message was edited>

[18/01/2024; 08;23;39] ; agbomejimuritadoh; *_SUMMARY OF THE POINTS RAISED AT THE MEDICAL CONFERENCE ON MALIGNANT DISEASES IN BERLIN - GERMANY._*

3. No to Maggie Cubes.

4. No carbonated juice (32 sugar cubes per liter).

5. No to processed sugars.

9. No to alcohol

10. No to reheating frozen meals.

13. Deodorants are dangerous; especially when used after shaving.

14. Breastfeeding is less likely to cause cancer than formula.

15. Cancer cells eat mostly sugar & all artificial sugar; even brown.

16.A cancer patient who abstains from sugar in his diet finds that his disease has receded & he or she can live a longer life.
Sugar = the mortal enemy.

17 A cup of beer stays in the body for 5 hours; and during this time the organs of the system work in slow motion because of the alcohol.

Yes to;

 1️⃣ Vegetables.

 2️⃣ Honey (original/natural) in reasonable quantity instead of sugar.

 3️⃣ Vegetable proteins like beans instead of meat.

 4⃣ Two glasses of water on an empty stomach before brushing your teeth and upon waking up by drinking water kept in the room at the same room temperature not water from refridgerator.

 5️⃣ Unheated meals.

 6️⃣ Anti-cancer juice;
  Aloe vera + ginger + parsley + celery + bromelain (pineapple middle)..
Mix and drink on an empty stomach.

7️⃣ Other anti-cancer juices; Corossol (seedless) + Bromalain.

8️⃣ Eat raw or cooked carrots or their juice daily.

The American Physicians Association gave answers to the cause of cancer;

 1️⃣ Don't drink tea from a plastic cup.

2️⃣ Don't eat anything hot in a paper or plastic bag. Example; potatoes (fries).

3️⃣ Don't use plastic in d microwave. RECALL;

🔴 When plastic comes in contact with heat; it creates chemicals that can cause 52 types of cancer.

 🔴 Inform your loved ones in order to be far from these bad things.

 ⚠ Avoid drinking Coca-Cola over pineapple or after eating pineapple for dessert.

Do not mix pineapple juice with Coke. THIS MIX IS ​​KILLER!

Do not eat egg after eating banana or the other way round. It kills immediately.

Do not eat banana after drinking milk. You will be restless and feel as if you have been poisoned.

People are dying ignorantly; mistakenly believing that they have been poisoned...they have been victims of their ignorance of these deadly food combinations.

OH GOD!!! FORGIVE US for lack of knowledge.```

Most of our ministers have so far been absent.

Ineffectual?
Incompetent?
Mis-assigned?
Confused?

I don't know. All I know is that they have; so far; been absent.

And given where Nigeria was when Tinubu took over; we cannot afford to have absentee ministers. We cannot afford absentee ministers because the president cannot micromanage 32 ministries even if he is superman. He needs at least 37 self-starting; go-getting men and women.

Right now; if you count the ministers of state;  we have 45. I have removed the junior ministers in the list below.

Let us start raising the alarm now before it's too late. 

Apart from Olubunmi Ojo (Interior); who has really become the superstar self-starter here(but now on investigation of embezzlement  conspiracy with Betta Edu); David Umahi (Works); who seems to know his onions; and Nyesom Wike (FCT); who is cleaning up Abuja; all the others are still...well...crawling.

They have not "hit the ground running"; to quote the president.

Okay; Wale Edun (Finance and Economy) seems to be doing things but we don't hear from him like we did from Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala under Obasanjo.

That's it! That's the issue! If we are not hearing from you; you are not doing anything.

We are not even hearing from the Minister of Information! I had to go look up his name again this morning - Muhammed Idris!

All their TV appearances before and during the election; Festus Keyamo (Aviation and Aerospace) and Dele Alake (Solid Minerals) have now virtually become camera shy!

Talk to us!
Keep on talking to us!
Even if you are not doing much yet; tell us what you plan to do...the difference you plan to make.
Give us hope.

1. Minister of Communications; Innovation and Digital Economy - Bosun Tijani (What exactly are you working on now? Tell us.)

 2. Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy - Wale Edun (Okay; we FEEL you. But talk to us more.)

3. Minister of Marine and Blue Economy -  Adegboyega Oyetola (What the heck have you been doing?)

4. Minister of Power - Adedayo Adelabu (What's up with our electricity? Or is it how we are going to be going with it? Abi se bayii lase maa maa baa lo?)

5. Minister of Solid Minerals Development - Dele Alake (Where art thou?)

6. Minister of Tourism - Lola Ade-John (Where are the best places to spend my vacation?)

7. Minister of Transportation -  Sa'idu Alkali (IToooor. Even if it is 1/4 of Rotimi Amaechi's visibility and speeches; even if it's 1/10th; let's see and hear you.)

8. Minister of Industry; Trade and Investment - Doris Anite (Doris who?)

9. Minister of Innovation Science and Technology - Uche Nnaji (Are you innovating or ENERVATING?)

10. Minister of Women Affairs - Uju Kennedy (Toooor. Issokay o.)

11. Minister of Works - David Umahi (Good job so far. But keep talking to us.)

12. Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development - Festus Keyamo (Where art thou?)

13. Minister of Youth - Abubakar Momoh (Toooor.)

14. Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation - Betta Edu (Help me understand how this is even a ministry and EFCC is currently investigating embezzlement allegations).

15. Minister of Sports Development - John Enoh (John who?)

16. Minister of Federal Capital Territory - Nyesom Wike (Keep up the good job. Nobody needs to tell you to talk more. If anything; uou probably need some attenuation🤣) 

17. Minister of Art; Culture and the Creative Economy - Hannatu Musawa (What exactly are you doing?)

18. Minister of Defence -  Mohammed Badaru (You definitely need to be talking to us at least once a week. We have serious security issues.)

19. Minister of Housing and Urban Development - Ahmed Dangiwa (Where art thou?)

20. Minister of Budget and Economic Planning - Atiku Bagudu (Okay; we see your hand. But you need to be talking to us.)

21. Minister of Agriculture and Food Security -  Abubakar Kyari (Me I am a farmer o. I haven't seen or heard anything you have done; are doing; or plan to do.)

22. Minister of Education - Tahir Maman (What exactly are you doing to actualize the promises in our manifesto? If you don't have a copy; I can send it to you.)

23. Minister of Interior - Olubunmi Ojo (Go on soun jare! Easily the most productive...most impactful minister we have had since 1999.)

24. Minister of Foreign Affairs; Yusuf Tuggar (You are there and all our embassies have been without ambassadors for about two months now. When are we getting new ambassadors? Talk to us.)

25. Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare - Ali Pate (Hehehehe. Any minister of health who is not publicly addressing health matters at least weekly is not serious.)

26. Minister of Police Affairs - Ibrahim Geidam (What about the police reforms; including state police that we promised in our manifesto?)

27. Minister of Steel Development - Shuaibu Audu (Steel or Steal? Talk to us.)

28. Minister of Information and National Orientation - Muhammed Idris (I have nothing more to say to you.)

29. Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice - Lateef Fagbemi (Maybe you don't need to talk. Maybe.)

30. Minister of Labour and Employment -  Simon Lalong (Abeg shift make pesin pass!) (UPDATE! Lalong resigned two weeks ago to take up his court-affirmed Senate victory.)

31. Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Govermental Affairs - Zephaniah Jisalo (Maybe you need to be replaced with Dr. Oladoyin Odebowale who wrote the book on how to run a special duties and strategy office. Talk to us; abeg.)

32. Minister of Water Resources and Sanitation - Joseph Utsev (Please don't make me laugh. These are serious matters.)

Fellow Nigerians; we need to start motivating these people to work before complacency sets in. You know that work basically stops around two years to the next election because they will be running around for election then. Let's start pressuring them.

Ko je bo se je.

Doxology.

PS; You have commissioners in your respective states too o. They are not immune.

I join many far and near friends and family to celebrate a man with big hearts; an amazing mentor ;sportsman ; servants leader; a unifier; a loyalist of the progressives family. Today 18th of January 2024 has he added another year to is age.

Hon Tajudeen Alimi Shittu; the former leader of the legislative House Agbado oke odo; a former supervisor of Agric; Agbado oke odo Lcda and the present party scribes of the All progressive congress APC Agbado oke odo Lcda.

To my Leader Hon Tajudeen Alimi shitu

Leaders are made they are not born with it!

Every successful person has a painful story; so never give up. A school bell that sounds like a disturbance at 8;am also sounds interesting at 2;pm... it is just a matter of time; so Don't envy anyone.

Not everyone walking fast has an appointment.Some have running stomachs!

If a rose smells better than tomatoes; It doesn't mean the rose can’t make a better stew. Don't try to compare yourself to others.You also have your strength; look for it and build on it.

All animals that exist;in Noah's ark.

snail is one of those animals. If God could wait long enough for snails to enter Noah's ark; His door of grace won't close till you reach your expected position in life. Never look down on yourself; keep looking up. Remember that Broken crayons still color. Keep on pushing; you never can tell how close You are to Your Goal.

I enter into the covenant of mercy to pray for you today; the Power that created something out of nothing shall miraculously open ways for you to enter into your inheritance and you shall possess your possessions.

The Lord will put you in the right location by His divine arrangement. He will place you where you will be seen and remembered for good today and always in Jesus name. Under His divine declaration today and beyond; you will begin to advance to the path of progress; prosperity and unending elevation. Amen 🙏 

Congratulations and Happy Birthday sir!.

*PRESS RELEASE*

*PUBLICATION OF FINAL LIST AND PERSONAL PARTICULARS OF CANDIDATES FOR BYE-ELECTIONS*
 
Nigerians may recall that recently the Commission released the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for bye-elections arising from the death or resignation of Members of the National and State Houses of Assembly. These elections will be held on Saturday 3rd February 2024 across nine States of the Federation covering two Senatorial Districts (Ebonyi South and Yobe East); four Federal Constituencies (Shanga/Ngaski/Yauri Federal Constituency of Kebbi State; Surulere I Federal Constituency of Lagos State; Akoko North East/Akoko North West Federal Constituency of Ondo State and Jalingo/Yorro/Zing Federal Constituency of Taraba State); and three State Constituencies (Guma I State Constituency of Benue State; Chibok State Constituency of Borno State and Chikun State Constituency of Kaduna State).
 
As provided in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities; the personal particulars and final list of candidates have been published today in our State offices and the affected constituencies pursuant to the provision of Section 29(3) of the Electoral Act; 2022. The list of candidates is also published on our website and social media platforms.
 
We appeal to Nigerians to scrutinize the personal particulars (Form EC9 and academic credentials) of the candidates. Any aspirant who participated in his/her party primaries with reasonable grounds to believe that the information provided by the candidate is false can challenge the nomination in a Federal high Court as provided in Section 29(5) of the Electoral Act 2022.
 
For clarity; this publication only applies to the forthcoming bye-elections as they are fresh elections for which political parties conducted primaries and nominated their candidates. For the re-run elections to be held on the same day; the list and personal particulars of candidates have been published before the 2023 General Election. The re-run elections are conducted pursuant to the orders of the Election Petition Appeal Tribunals. They are not fresh elections open to new/disqualified candidates which obviates the need to publish their personal particulars again.

PRESS RELEASE;

RE; RELOCATION OF FAAN CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS FROM ABUJA TO LAGOS

The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria notes the inquiries some Nigerians have made regarding the directive of the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development; Mr. Festus Keyamo; SAN; CON; to relocate the corporate Headquarters of FAAN from Abuja to its original base; Lagos; where it has operated for decades until recently. 

FAAN wishes to inform Nigerians that following wide consultations by the new Management of FAAN with stakeholders; which also involved the Unions; it was agreed that this was in the best interest of the Authority and the country for now for the following reasons;

1. Those affected by the decision to move the headquarters to Abuja have since returned to Lagos as there is no office space for them in Abuja. It was ill-advised in the first place to move the headquarters to Abuja when there was no single FAAN building in Abuja to accommodate all of them at once. 

2. Having returned to Lagos; the Authority would be liable to pay them DTA (DUTY TOUR ALLOWANCE) because technically they are working OUT OF STATION as their official posting is to ABUJA. The Minister has decided to stop this waste of public resources and rip-off on the public purse.

3. ⁠The other option open to the Authority was abandon the old FAAN building in Lagos to rot away and to use its scarce resources to rent an office space in Abuja for Millions of Naira of public money when in actual fact more than sixty percent of its activities are in Lagos given the huge passenger volume of the Lagos airports. The stakeholders and the Minister decided against that and to save the country this waste. 

4. ⁠The Minister has rolled out plans to get concessionaires to build befitting offices for the Authority in Lagos and Abuja and until that is done; the Authority will continue to manage its old building in Lagos that can accommodate all its Directors and senior officials for now. 

5. ⁠Abuja continues to have full operational offices and the Authority has not scaled down operations in Abuja one bit. It is just the technical decision of where the Authority has its ‘corporate headquarters’ that has been taken without affecting the structure of operations as they are for now in both cities. 

6. ⁠In the near future; when befitting  corporate buildings have been built for the Authority in both Lagos and Abuja; a final decision will be taken as to the location of the permanent headquarters; depending on the exigencies of the time. 

7. The Authority wishes to assure members of the public that it will continue to act in the best interest of the public and the country. 

8. The Honourable Minister is committed to taking decisions that are in the best interest of the country; especially as it concerns public funds and will not yield to ethnic or sectional sentiments that will derail this commitment’

Thank you.

*PRESS RELEASE;*

*RE; RELOCATION OF FAAN CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS FROM ABUJA TO LAGOS*

*The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria notes the inquiries some Nigerians have made regarding the directive of the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development; Mr. Festus Keyamo; SAN; CON; to relocate the corporate Headquarters of FAAN from Abuja to its original base; Lagos; where it has operated for decades until recently.*

FAAN wishes to inform Nigerians that following wide consultations by the new Management of FAAN with stakeholders; which also involved the Unions; it was agreed that this was in the best interest of the Authority and the country for now for the following reasons;

1. Those affected by the decision to move the headquarters to Abuja have since returned to Lagos as there is no office space for them in Abuja. It was ill-advised in the first place to move the headquarters to Abuja when there was no single FAAN building in Abuja to accommodate all of them at once. 

2. Having returned to Lagos; the Authority would be liable to pay them DTA (DUTY TOUR ALLOWANCE) because technically they are working OUT OF STATION as their official posting is to ABUJA. The Minister has decided to stop this waste of public resources and rip-off on the public purse.

3. ⁠The other option open to the Authority was abandon the old FAAN building in Lagos to rot away and to use its scarce resources to rent an office space in Abuja for Millions of Naira of public money when in actual fact more than sixty percent of its activities are in Lagos given the huge passenger volume of the Lagos airports. The stakeholders and the Minister decided against that and to save the country this waste. 
4. ⁠The Minister has rolled out plans to get concessionaires to build befitting offices for the Authority in Lagos and Abuja and until that is done; the Authority will continue to manage its old building in Lagos that can accommodate all its Directors and senior officials for now. 
5. ⁠Abuja continues to have full operational offices and the Authority has not scaled down operations in Abuja one bit. It is just the technical decision of where the Authority has its ‘corporate headquarters’ that has been taken without affecting the structure of operations as they are for now in both cities. 
6. ⁠In the near future; when befitting  corporate buildings have been built for the Authority in both Lagos and Abuja; a final decision will be taken as to the location of the permanent headquarters; depending on the exigencies of the time. 
7. The Authority wishes to assure members of the public that it will continue to act in the best interest of the public and the country. 
8. The Honourable Minister is committed to taking decisions that are in the best interest of the country; especially as it concerns public funds and will not yield to ethnic or sectional sentiments that will derail this commitment’

Thank you.

[19/01/2024; 16;56;40] Obafemi Oshungboye; Become a ghost. Forget attention. Just grow in private. Here's why...

A Thread🧵🧵

1. The less you share; the less likely people will be in your business.

2. You'll slowly stop caring about people's opinion on you.

3. You won't have to seek validation to do what feels right for you.

4. If everyone is your friend; you've a problem. You can't trust anyone with personal information.

5. You'll attract peace into your life. You'll experience less drama; toxic energy and more time alone.

6. The real flex is being private; staying low-key and telling no one about your life.

7. It'll be 10x easier to walk some paths alone to achieve your personal goals.

8. Privacy teaches you independence and how to connect with people on a deeper level.

9. Everyone leaves. You'll learn how to be alone and not feel lonely.

That’s why I chose solitude ever since.

10. When you build in silence; people don’t know what to attack.

11. People will want to know more about you when you talk less about yourself.

12. People don't care so much about you. They only care on what you can offer.

13. You'll owe no one any explanation about your personal life.

14. Not everyone is your friend; live a private life to never attract bad energy.

15. You'll learn when to be alone and when to be with others.

Remember SON;

-Privacy is key

-Do not commit to anyone

-Use absence to increase your respect.

TODAY'S LESSON 

    💞SIGNS OF A BAD WIFE 💞
       Part One

💕Marriage is one of the most important decisions you will make in your life. It requires a serious commitment that’s made between two right people for the right reasons.

💖A lot of marriages come to an end not because there was infidelity in the marriage but because either one or both partners were bad to each other and this led to certain actions that contributed to marital instability.

💓A bad wife is mostly defined by one sign – egotism. A bad wife is someone who doesn’t make an effort in the relationship or doesn’t contribute to making the relationship good and healthy. 

💕She is someone who doesn’t respect her husband and doesn’t prioritize him for any particular reason.

I am removing the wrong people from your life and positioning you for something better and bigger. They thought they hurt you; but I am the One who removed them. Stop crying over the loss and disappointment.
You need to refocus your energy on the new things I am birthing in your life. Believe in what I am doing.
Everything will end in your favor." ♥️🙏🏽

Trust this intel meets you well.

We are writing to bring your attention to a critical security alert we have received from the Lagos State Police Command.

According to the information provided; there has been an increase in kidnapping incidents along the Gbagada Expressway. The perpetrators are employing the "one chance" method of targeting unsuspecting commuters. Report also says that they are utilizing “Danfo” vehicles carrying up to 5 individuals.

In light of this alarming situation; we strongly urge everyone to exercise extreme caution when commuting through this area. Please remain vigilant and take necessary precautions to ensure your personal safety. Avoid late nights and if possible; consider alternative routes or means of transportation until the security situation is brought under control.

We advise that you share this information with your family and friends; as heightened awareness and collective vigilance are crucial in maintaining the safety and well-being of our community.

[20/01/2024; 20;54;47] Comrade Adebayo; Don't Loose your Contacts because of Politics....

Taking a moment to reflect on the statement of intent from a political figure; I examined my contacts; friends; and social groups across all divides. With this in mind; I began placing bets on each one but soon realized that time was of the essence. 

My thoughts turned to what would happen if Atiku aligned with Wike or if Daniel Bwala agreed to work with Asiwaju - or even if Reno spoke positively about him. It dawned on me that relationships hold more weight than mere political cliques.

It's worth noting that Asiwaju supported Atiku in the past and Kwankwaso remains a close friend despite their differing political views. This just goes to show that accomplishments should outweigh partisan affiliations. Obanikoro dined with Asiwaju while Ogunlewe disagreed with him; yet now his son serves as a local government chairman.

In light of this; we must prioritize building strong relationships above all else since politics revolves around personal interests and vice versa. 

Nevertheless; when it's all said and done we will stand together shoulder-to-shoulder like Atiku and Ganduje did during their recent Jumat prayer photo op.

To my dear friend; let us both grow up and understand that our lives extend beyond politics - before it begins and long after it ends - so we can make the most out of every precious moment we have on this earth. We must not allow ourselves to be consumed by politics alone but rather focus on cultivating meaningful relationships that will enrich our lives for years to come. 

After all; it is these relationships that truly matter in the end and will ultimately define our legacy for generations to come.

[21/01/2024; 11;31;21] ; EASY LIFE VENTURES; *Kidnapping On The Increase Now; Please take note of the following measures!!!*

The only way to be your brother's keeper in Nigeria today is by sharing any security tips that can be of help.

We wish to share with you some few security tips to guard your daily activities henceforth because the current state of insecurity in the country is really alarming.

The only person to trust now in this country is yourself and your God! Therefore; to avoid being a victim of kidnapping; please read the following tips and share with your loved ones now to save them from harm.

Tip 1. Never use car stickers that say where you work; especially if you have a prestigious job.

Tip 2. When travelling; don't leave too early and make sure you are at your destination before 6 pm at latest.  

Tip 3. Never share pictures of your kids in their school uniforms or badges. Protect your kids!

Tip 4. When you attend parties; don't let the band get you so high that you start spraying money. Use an envelope.

Tip 5. Don't be the one that tries to empty the ATM machine by making large withdrawals. You don't need 50k in your wallet to feel like a man.

Tip 6. Always delete your bank transaction notifications; especially SMS. You really can memorize your bank balance; and don't forget to shred/destroy your POS/ATM receipts.

Tip 7. Don't go jogging while it's dark. You really should be smarter than that. If you can; get someone trusted as company.

Tip 8.  Always lock your doors; even if you're only going out to switch off your generator.

Tip 9. NEVER! NEVER EVER WEAR YOUR ID Card outside your workplace. No one needs to know where you work

Tip 10. Be accountable to your spouse or parents; and let someone know where you are at every point.

Tip 11. As much as you can; don't send kids alone on errand outside your house. They are soft targets.

Tip 12. Don't try to show that you are the richest in the neighbourhood by making large donations in your estate meetings and learning modesty.

Tip 13. When you give; give with modesty and privately; learn to say "I can't spare that amount now." 

Tip 14. Don't stay late in your office long after closing hours. That deadline work can be done later or at home if you wish.

Tip 15. Make safety the number one factor in your decision always!

Tip 16. Mind what you post about yourself on social media.

Tip 17. Never make any attempt to open your gate/door to even your child; brother; or any relative in the night; particularly dead nights. They might be used to get you easily. NO MATTER WHAT JUST TELL THEM; TILL IN THE MORNING.

It is important that you share this now. Someone somewhere may need this today.

If you massage a lady here and she gets arouse along the line and she ask you to take a break and you continue; you will end up in jail. I think the profession in Nigeria lacks some moral standards; I guess.  You have the right to choose who must massage you; either a man or a woman. it's your choice. For me; I prefer a man to massage me because of the strong bones while some men  like @2348137096721 will prefer a woman because of the soft touch 😂😂😂😂. Massaging is very good for blood circulation.  It prevents stroke.

Victory for Democracy 

*FOR RECORDS......*


*THE COURT OF APPEAL HAS OVERRULED THE PAYMENT OF PENSION; GRATUITY OR SEVERANCE ALLOWANCE TO POLITICAL OFFICE HOLDERS*

*The Court of Appeal has faulted the payment of either severance allowance; pension or gratuity to political office holders and political appointees; insisting that the practice was morally wrong.*

*A three-man panel of the court; held that  it as unjustifiable in the face of the nation’s socio-economic reality for some few politicians; who hold office for not more than eight-year; to allocate huge public funds to themselves in the name of pension and severance package while civil servants; who committed most of their active years to the service of the nation are denied their retirement benefits.*

*The Court of Appeal; Abuja said this in a judgment on an appeal marked; CA/A/810/2017 filed by the Governor of Kogi State and three others.*

*The Court of Appeal; in its lead judgment by Justice Emmanuel Agim; said it was wicked and morally wrong for political office holders and political appointees; who helped themselves to public funds while in office; to claim entitlement to pension and severance allowances.*

*Justice Agim said; “I must state here that the claimants’ claim for payment of severance allowance; because the tenure of their appointment has come to an end; is as unfounded as is morally wrong"*

*“As I have held that their letters of appointment did not stipulate their entitlement to such payment. They did not produce any law or any document or instrument that entitles them to such payment.*

*“The fact that elected pubic officeholders and political appointees are paid huge amounts of money as monthly salaries and other forms of allowances; while in office; is common knowledge in Nigeria and is not reasonable to open question"*

*“It is also common knowledge that many of them after an office tenure of between three to eight years become stupendously wealthy; exhibiting mind-blowing opulence and splendor"*

*“Yet these office holders insist on being paid severance allowance for holding such offices"*

*“Meanwhile; career civil servants; who have served this country or their states or Local Governments; all their life; can hardly collect their pensions and gratuity when retired"*

*“They are now being subjected to contributory pension schemes in which they contribute part of their monthly meagre salaries that are always paid in arrears while in service; to be able to earn pension and gratuity upon retirement"*

*“The political appointees and elected public office holders; who do not work as long and as hard as the career civil servants quickly get paid huge severance allowances upon leaving office in addition to the huge wealth they acquired while holding such offices and without having been subjected to any contributory pension schemes"*

*“It is not morally right to pay an elected public officer or political appointee pension and gratuity or severance allowance for holding such an office for three to eight years as the case may be"*

I think you need to understand the world is changing very fast.

Women are multitasking and in all fairness they need to feel more confidence ; healthy and comfortable.

Many men pay for that services for their wife’s just for her to be more relaxed and healthy.

If the woman is engaging in such act without the approval of the husband. That can create misunderstandings among themselves. But then the husband can have a decent conversation without necessarily embarrassing himself in public like we saw in the video.

2024 no gree for nobody.

A woman can do massage for her fellow woman; the massage of thing is a profession it doesn't necessarily need muscles the way we all take it to be...

If massage go wrong no man would like it; then we would tag the. Woman to be promiscuous or adulterous forgetting it's blood that flow in their veins too..

I rather stay cultural than allow that to happen bro.. I sincerely mean it women are flexible please let's get it straight and let's not put our homes on the risk of destruction.

Let’s learn to trust our women (wife’s) women that has being loyal with us for more than 10yrs above needs some serious attention too.

Being over protective is good but we need to give them attention and try to be creative just to have a happy home. Men know how to relax but ignoring the fact that women also has blood flowing in them. Neglecting that fact will create disharmony in many homes.

Let’s do those crazy things we do outside with them at home.

Cultural man.

Can we ask ourselves questions?

When last did we take our wife clubbing?

When last did we and the children go to the beach asking her to be on her bikini dress.

When last did we take them to have dinner outside our comfort zones.

[22/01/2024; 13;40;54] ; Biola Koyi; *"STEALING REDUCES A MAN"* 

...Never in my life have I met humans as civilized as the Japanese. They're the true resemblance of image of God.

During my first trip to Japan; a colleague from the US forgot his laptop at the park; of all places. We rushed back there and the place was closed for the day.

Everyone was relaxed except me and my friend. Even the taxi driver wasn't bothered. He promised to drive us there by 9;00 a.m. next day because Park opens 8.45 a.m. 

He assured us we would get it back; that Japanese do not steal because stealing reduces a man. 

That statement almost knocked me to the ground. This was 2012 not 1912.

I think anybody who is afraid of making heaven should visit Japan before dying because that's closest to the best humans can get to. 

And that will give the person a picture of how organized heaven might be.

These are people who apologize because you heard the sound of their ringtone.

About 90% of Japanese leave their phones on silent mode so as not to disturb the next person. 

They all have earpiece and are thinking of stopping having horns in cars because nobody uses it.

Long and short of the story is that we got there the next morning and the attendant took us to where we sat and behold the laptop was there.

It’s not by mistake that they are that prosperous. The gross mentality and personality of a people determines their level of wealth.

"Stealing reduces a man" - Can we just have this on a billboard in every open place in Nigeria; including Aso Rock. 

Thank you."

President Bola Tinubu has directed the management of the Nigeria Education Loan Fund (NELFUND) to expand its focus area by extending interest-free loans to Nigerian students interested in skill-development programmes.

The President issued this directive at the State House on Monday after a briefing from Mr. Akintunde Sawyerr; Executive Secretary of NELFUND; on the build-up to the launch of the programme later in the month.

The President said it is important for the scheme to accommodate those who may not want to pursue university education; noting that skill acquisition is as important as obtaining undergraduate and graduate academic qualifications.

"This is not an exclusive programme. It is catering to all of our young people. Young Nigerians are gifted in different areas. This is not only for those who want to be doctors; lawyers; and accountants. It is also for those who aspire to use their skilled and trained hands to build our nation. In accordance with this; I have instructed NELFUND to explore all opportunities to inculcate skill-development programmes because not everybody wants to go through a full university education;" he said.

President Tinubu emphasized the need for equity and inclusivity in the management of the programme; stating; "No matter how economically challenged you are; accredited and qualified students will and must have access to this loan to advance their education in higher institutions. There is no compromise in our commitment to the disadvantaged citizens of this nation."

In his presentation to the President; Executive Secretary of the Fund; Mr. Akintunde Sawyerr; said the loan application process will be technology-driven; limiting human interface and "eliminating any possibility of maladministration in the programme." 

"By design; this is a perpetual programme and will not terminate. The funds; earmarked for bona-fide Nigerian students; will be disbursed directly to the institutions in the initial phase through electronic transfer. Our students will be catered to in a way that bypasses human interference through the full utilization of available technological platforms; in adherence to Your Excellency's stated objectives;" he said.

He also said NELFUND has developed a robust risk-mitigation mechanism to address potential risks that may arise from the programme.

Speaking on the funding mechanism of the programme; Dr. Zacch Adedeji; Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS); said funding sources have been made available to ensure the smooth take-off and sustenance of the programme.

"Mr. President is permanently solving the problem of funding for education in Nigeria. By the directive of the President; the Education Tax Fund is being reviewed to additionally cater to the needs of our university students across all local government areas in the country as they seek to access vocational and traditional university education. Funding for the programme will be adequately covered;" he said.

[23/01/2024; 10;56;16] ; adeleketaiwoelizabeth298; *NIGERIAN BANKS HAVE FINISHED THIS NATION!*

They are silent killers and unarmed robbers.

If you're in doubt; below are series of charges always placed on innocent customers in a single banking transaction.

1 VAT.
2. Account maintenance charges
3. SMS alert charges
4. Transfer charges
5. Postal STAMP DUTY charges
6. Weekend charges.

Now; the Apex bank; the unarmed robbers' boss introduced a CASHLESS ECONOMY whereby everyone does not need to carry cash for any transaction.

The problem is this; I am Cement Trader. The landing cost of a bag of cement is #3;550 while we sell #3;600. That is a profit of just #50 per bag of cement.

Now on every 2 bags of cement; a customer transfers #7;200 into my account due to CASHLESS policy and my profit is #100.

To my amazement; the bank deducted the following on that transaction!

1. #53 transfer charges.
2. #100 Postal STAMP duty.
3. #6.98 VAT.
4. #76 SMS alerts charges.
5. #93.13 account maintenance charges. 

If that was not enough; on every single transaction; both account FROM which money is being transferred and the account TO which money is being transferred were charged for same transaction.

If you're in doubt; find out by requesting for your account statement.

Don't forget the bank had already laid off and reduced number of staff due to self service banking system o bcos more customers don't have to visit banking hall for transaction again. 

So. Amount being paid on salaries and allowances of staff has dropped. 
Did the CBN Governor or FED government know what they are doing at all.?

Or it was a deliberate act of exploiting the poor citizens?
So; we are now being tricked; enslaved by Government and the Bank?

This government will still come and collect income tax; trade permit at both state and federal level.

Who do we offend in Nigeria for us to have such extremely bad leaders; worst agencies and bad Nation like this?

No wonder businesses are folding up and liquidated on daily basis!?!

No wonder people now bury cash in cemeteries  and farms?
Our Senators and House of Rep members who are  supposed to be vanguard of the common people are not but a curse as well.

Who will put an end to all this injustice?

While I run around in the rain and sun for business to survive; the bank management just sit back in air conditioning and relax to feed on our sweat.
Very soon; they will complain of shortage of cash in circulation because people will find alternative savings and security for the cash.

 *Please; kindly help repost until it gets to the appropriate authorities to end the Nigerian Bank madness.* 
 *Nigerias lawyers do something about this * ..

It was further gathered that officials of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority were meeting with the management of the refinery to perfect the pricing template for products produced by the facility.

Day 24 of 366.

God is saying to you today;
"I know a lot of things aren't going well in your lite right now.
There seems to be nobody there to help you. Hold on. I'm about to fulfill My promises to you.
Hold tight to Me; and I will take you where you need to go. I will take you further than you could ever imagine. I did not bring you this far to fail you now. It may be rough; but I still have a plan." ♥️🙏🏽

[24/01/2024; 05;04;57] Comrade Obadina; Asiwaju said *Democracy is wicked*
In politics your best friend can be your worst enemy.

But I pray DA to get out of this too..

The handwritten is boldly clear during Iganmode day to Yayi himself despite spending over 80% of the money used to organsed the event.

[24/01/2024; 05;19;56] Comrade Obadina; *COPIED*
DEPUTY GOVERNOR IN OTA 
IS IT A BLESSING OR A CURSE?

Hon Lai Taiwo 

I'm been forced to ask this question because of show of shame; abuse and arrogant display of power by the office of the deputy governor during the just concluded Iganmode day festival 

A letter was sent to Sen Adeola Solomon to Co host this year festival of Ota people together with our own DEPUTY governor and the GOVERNOR as Chief Host. He wanted to turn it down politely and I'm aware of the reason part of is insult he received from our people I have to personally appeal to him to honor and do whatever he can do for the success of the festival. 

Yayi paid for the stage the Sound system and the Musician Pasuma that played that day the total cost can not be less 10m naira. Our own daughter the deputy governor only paid for the cost of an MC from Abeokuta the main objective is to come and discredit Yayi and make sure Yayi the Senator representing our Ogun west in the red chamber and the Chairman committee that is in charge of budget was given chance to talk. It has never happened during Iganmode day that an MC will be brought from outside to come and anchor our program. 

When Yayi entered the venue with an intimidating crowd the MC brought by He standing on the stage paid for by Yayi and using the public address system brought by Yayi to talk nonsense. Unfortunately for me I was busy attending to our party members I would have walked to the stage take the mic from him and pushed him down the stage and asked him to go and meet the person who brought him there to provide him with the stage and mic to address her people. 
The show of shame was so glaring by the MC that he did not acknowledge the presence of notable personalities like chief Mrs Apampa; Baba Ajibola; chief Agemo; Alh Popoola who have been at the venue as early 12noon. There is no where the governor will see them and he will not acknowledge their presence. 

When Iganmode festival took off on Monday Jigi Yayi and free Medical services was equally flagged off at the palace so that our people who came for the festival will benefit; our own deputy governor called the Chairman of the committee of Iganmode not to allow the program to take place because it is Awori festival and Yayi is a Yewa man. The question is it not our own Ota people that will benefit from this. That day we were fully prepared waiting for the bastard that will stop the program. The turn out was so impressive  free eye text and glasses and expensive drugs were distributed. There was a case of a 12yr old girl that has problem with one of her eyes I took her to see the doctor after examination the doctor concluded she would need surgery her particular was collected and promised to recommend to Yayi to bear the total cost of the surgery. 

Sen Solomon Adeola has embarked on more than 16 projects going on across our LG 
Ota Itele road ready for asphalting 
Town event center along Itele road 
ICU of international standards at Ota general hospital 
Massive construction in Iganmode grammar school 
Massive construction at police school idimu 
Road construction at Abule iroko 
Martina road in Sango 
Massive construction at st Steven pry school Ado odo 
Construction of open and locked up at Lusada market 
Road construction at Ado odo 
Anglican odo pako; Bible College road and I also recommended Temidire road which is bad shape 

In terms of empowerment more than  five thousand of indigens of this LG have benefited from this Yayi program. They were trained and given equipment and money to start their business. These equipment include sewing machines; Drier Welding machines vulcanized units  Deep freezer etc. Yayi has distributed Transformers to different communities in Ota with one million naira installation fees. 

What is the benefits of having deputy governor in Ota when wrong and bad decision was taken that Egba TRADITIONAL COUNCIL was the prescribed Authority over SANGO OTA at the State Exco with both deputy governor and Tunji Akinosi in attendance 

What is the benefits of having deputy governor in Ota that can not use her position to solve the Alatan of Atan issue the file has been on Commissioner for Justice who shared the same building with HE 

Yayi that you use your instrument of office to prevent from addressing the people of Ota paid 2million naira to buy 500 pieces of Ankara that were distributed to our local people at home the ones you bought were shared in Abeokuta and few at home and you saw the the results on the field that day. Our people would have made one million naira on the transaction and they will be happy 

Ur excy I was expecting you to bring some of your fellow deputy governor to Iganmode day like Yayi did during Yewa festival to donate but instead you invited a minister another Iyeru Okin omo OLOFA MOJO to come and introduce himself as your cousin at the of the speech kilo bade how much did he donate nothing 

Last year Akesan day at Iperu the governor Prince Dapo Abiodun invited Yayi to the event when he was called to deliver his speech he donated 50m here because of abuse of power Senator representing us in the senate was prevented to deliver his speech 

Wether Yayi was allowed to talk or not the people of Ota have spoken they have demonstrated their love for you with your triumphant entry in to the venue with the unprecedented large crowd that followed you 
I appeal to our Senator to ignore all that happened that day. 

To know how popular Yayi is in Ota I challenge you all for popularity trek in some of the major streets in Ota and see the results

*To be honest this is not their initiative. It was the blue print since Governor SLS*.

Abuja Head Quarters cannot accommodate everything. The thought was since most of the systemically important banks Head Quarters are in Lagos; those departments that are supervisory in nature should relocate for effectiveness and cost minimization. That was why SLS demolished the old head office building in Lagos and rebuilt a modern building to accommodate the vision. 
However; in subsequent years after he left two things happened;

1) The Directors at that time didn't want to relocate bcos of the rigours of Lagos and the convenience of Abuja;

2) with the massive political employments in CBN ; the Head Office was over populated. Majority of those young men and women prefer to work only in Abuja and the Head Office; and so it was. 
I am of the view that what the current management is doing is corrective and should be supported. 
Those young boys that were untouchable bcos of their political lineage and are beginning to see the rule of law re-emerging. It is not their prerogative to determine where they should work. After all; everyone signed a declaration that the Bank can post you anywhere at its own discretion. 
We are beginning to see the restoration of discipline in the system. 
The act of the new Management should not be politicised.

Embattled former Minister for Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation; Beta Edu; had an opportunity to see Bola Tinubu few days ago. Tinubu asked her to come clean and reveal all she has done and those involved in her six months of looting the Ministey she oversees. Edu’s revelations were shocking to Tinubu. He couldn’t hear that alone; he invited the First Lady; Remi; to come listen to Edu’s song of revelation. 
The constant naming of the Chief of Staff; Femi Gbajabiamila; as a major accomplice in Edu’s service of fraud to Nigeria; with billions missing and unaccounted for in her six months reign as Minister;  baffled the President and his wife. Remi particularly had severally intervened to save Gbajabiamila’s job. Tinubu’s decision to have her listen to Edu was so she has no more reason to plead on Gbajabiamila’s behalf when he dangles the hammer. 
Edu pleaded for a second chance and to have her job back. It was a resounding NO from the President and his wife. They wished her well in her future endeavors; promising her they would continue to be in touch. 
Beta wept after her songs of revelation as she was asked to go home and sin no more.
As for  Gbajabiamila; he has now been stripped off some of his major assignments. Bola Tinubu’s Private Secretary; Hakeem Muri-Okunola; and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation. SGF; George Akume; would now do most of the jobs instead of Gbajabiamila. Gbaja’s days are now numbered; an Aso Rock insider confirmed!

In our relentless pursuit of transforming infrastructure; I will like to provide an update on our 18.75km Lekki Epe Expressway Road project. 

On February 1; 2023; we commissioned phase one; giving the mandate of creating a world-class and long-lasting road to Messrs Craneburg Construction; which starts from Eleko to Epe T-Junction—ensuring a smoother commute for all.

Without missing a beat; we embarked on phase two; navigating a challenging stretch from Eleko junction to Abraham Adesanya. This isn't just about roads; it's about reshaping the landscape for a seamless experience.

To the resilient residents of Sangotedo; Ogidan; Abijo; Rainoil; and all along Lekki-Epe Expressway; your patience fuels our progress. Please; continue to bear with us as the project is getting to the end. We are promising not just roads but a transformative journey toward enhanced connectivity and convenience. 

I will continue to provide updates even as we look forward to the completion of this project.

*COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT THE END OF AFENIFERE GENERAL MEETING THAT HELD AT THE AKURE RESIDENCE OF THE LEADER; PA REUBEN FASORANTI; OFR; ON WEDNESDAY; JANUARY 24; 2024.*

*The pan-Yoruba socio-cultural and political organization; Afenifere; on Wednesday; January 24; 2024; held its first general meeting in the new year in the Akure home of the Leader; Pa Reuben Famuyide Fasoranti; OFR.*

*After the opening prayer; The Leader; Pa Fasoranti; welcomed members and congratulated everyone for surviving the year 2023.*

*He prayed for a successful 2024 and beyond.In attendance at the meeting were representatives from various State Chapters of Afenifere.*

A motion on the need to abrogate the dual positions of Acting Leader and Deputy Leader was moved by Dr. S. J. Ibikunle from Ogun State.

It was seconded by Members from Ekiti; Kwara; Oyo and Ondo States. When the matter was thrown to the general house; the motion was unanimously carried.

Flowing from this; the Leader then declared as follows;”In the light of recent events and the pressing need to reposition and rejuvenate Afenifere; it has been decided as follow;

1. The position of Acting Leader and Deputy Leader have now been abrogated.

2. The responsibilities and authority of advising the Leader of Afenifere and Asiwaju Yoruba are now vested in the Afenifere Elders Caucus which is hereby constituted.

Afterwards; further deliberations commenced.At the instance of the Leader; His Royal Majesty; Oba Olu Falae; presided over the meeting. Participants condoled the people of Ondo State over the demise of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu.

The meeting also congratulated the people on the inauguration of Otunba Lucky Orimisan Ayedatiwa as new Governor of the state just as participants lauded President Ahmed Bola Tinubu for his role in resolving the earlier impasse following the call by Ondo State Elders; under the auspices of Pa Fasoranti to do so.

Participants expressed shock over the blast that occurred in Ibadan on Tuesday; January 14; 2024 and condoled with the government and people of Oyo State over the unfortunate incident. They also commiserated with the people of Plateau State over the attack on their communities by terrorists.

The meeting then deliberated on issues affecting Yorubaland and Nigeria as a whole with particular reference to the socio-economic and security situations in the country. Restructuring as a means towards a new lease of life and a better Nigeria was also discussed.

After comprehensive deliberations; the meeting then resolved as follow;

1. There is an urgent need to rework the Security Architecture of the country to ensure that Nigerians are able to live and move about without the fear of being kidnapped or harassed in any way. Such reworking should include giving states and local government councils that so desire to establish own police services with all the requisite powers to function as such. Doing so would check; if not totally stop; the incidences of kidnapping and sundry banditry now ravaging the land.

2. The unfortunate blast in Ibadan clearly underscores the need to allow the federating units in the country to control mineral resources in their respective areas with particular reference to mining and exploration. The reasoning behind this was that had it been that states were in control of mining for instance; Oyo State government was likely to know how explosives were being moved around. Such would have made last week’s horrendous blast that claimed many lives; traumatized hundreds of people and destroyed properties running into Billions of Naira would have been prevented.

3. To facilitate the issues in 1 and 2 above; Afenifere again reiterated that the time for Restructuring the country is NOW. It therefore urged President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to set the machinery in motion for the purpose. The organization took note of the fact that the President; a known democrat and federalist would not hesitate to do things that will quicken the country’s quest for true federalism in which people would have self-determination within the context of one nation that is genuinely democratic and federal.

4. The meeting took note of the report that Miyetti Allah Hore set up a 1;144-strong Nomad Vigilante militia in Nassarawa ostensibly to provide security for Fulani herders. Afenifere was of the opinion that Miyetti Allah; being a non-state actor; should not have power to do a thing like that. It therefore considered the action of the Department of State Security (DSS) to checkmate Miyetti Allah on the issue as timely and in order.

5. The meeting expressed the hope that President Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda would be giving the necessary push so that life can be easier for the people of Nigeria. Among the means of achieving this are taking steps that would strengthen the value of our currency; the Naira; reduce costs of energy (fuel in particular) through local production of petroleum products as well as regular supply of electricity.

6. In view of the current high cost of living; Afenifere urged the Federal Government; through its various organs in charge of finance and fiscal policies; to accelerate actions that will strengthen the value of our currency; enhance productivity; reduce costs of items and services all geared towards reducing inflation and enhancing the welfare of the people.

7. The meeting renewed its call on governments in Yoruba speaking states to further encourage the teaching and usage of Yoruba language in schools. This can be done by making the language the medium for teaching at elementary and lower level of secondary education as well as making it compulsory for students at school certificate examination level.

It also urged parents and guardians to teach their children the language as well as encourage its usage as much as possible both in verbal and literary communications.

At the end of the meeting; The Leader encouraged Afenifere members to be more committed to the noble ideals that the organization stands for and display Omoluabi ethos as they project Afenifere further in their respective states.

He prayed for the success of government at all levels so that the people can enjoy a better lease of life.

[25/01/2024; 21;36;13] Fisfad; Plato said and I quote " In order to talk about a good life; we have to talk about a good society; in order to talk about a good society; we have to talk about the kind of education that will bring such society into existence and sustain it.       Education is the major solution to the challenges of ignorance. 



Thanks for investing in education; monitor the CBT registration so that the learners won't choose wrong combinations; take charge of the admission process of the specified UTME candidates; together we can make AGBADO OKE-ODO- LCDA the best place for all.

[25/01/2024; 22;58;56] ; Adebowale Awosheye; IMPORTANT 5 LESSONS/ FACTS A LEADER MUST NOTE.

1 .A leader who allows himself/herself to be surrounded by liars; disloyal and self serving subordinate will end up with no lagacy.

2 .A leader who his or her subordinate shares different interests; ideologies; views in other to control powers in the name of being loyal to his or her cause should sleep with two eyes opened.

3 .A leader who refuses to review his or her subordinates past; attitude; games; strength; goals and plans. Will eventually go blind forever and dies with regret.

4 .A leader must be aware that success is the most difficult thing to manage and to be maintained with those he or she climbs the ladder of achievement. Because an high level of entitlement may set in whereby truncating the achievement thus far.

5 .A leader must be ready to take harder steps; actions show the door to those that refuse to keep faith. He must deliberately build useful talents that believe in his or her dreams to maintain and move to the next level.

Thanks.

To whom it may concern.

[26/01/2024; 10;02;32] Alfa Gafaru Council; *The APC National Chairman Abdullahi Ganduje; has appealed to Governor Abba Yusuf of Kano to dump the NNPP; in the state to join the APC.*

Speaking at the stakeholders meeting in Kano on Thursday; Mr Ganduje; said Mr Yusuf’s joining of the APC will make Kano a one-party state.

According to him; at the end of the meeting; APC had resolved to woo all other smaller parties into the umbrella of APC.

Mr Ganduje assured that the APC would provide enabling environment for Mr Yusuf and his supporters to enjoy peace and harmony in the APC.

“We have achieved in wooing some governors to join APC. Very soon some governors will join our party. So; if we can do this at national level; why can’t we do it at state level?

“Our hands are wide open. We are appealing to those who like to join our party. In particular; we are inviting the governor of Kano state to dump his party; NNPP; and join APC.

“We are calling him. We promise to create enabling environment for the governor of Kano State so that we make a solid; a very big followership.

“This is a reflection of our population since we are the most populous state in the federation;” Mr Ganduje said.

The Government of Ogun State has keenly taken note of the events on the floor of the Ogun State House of Assembly on Tuesday regarding the alleged impeachment of the Speaker of the Assembly; Honourable Olakunle Oluomo; by members of the legislative arm during a sitting presided over by the Deputy Speaker; Honourable Bolanle Ajayi. 

Working with the leadership of our Party; the All Progressives Congress (APC); the Government intends to see all the contending issues resolved in a democratic; fair; and just manner.

There had been internal wrangling in the Assembly that had persisted and degenerated despite several interventions.

The Ogun State Government notes that the Honourable Members have openly stated that their grouse is not with the Governor; whom they again pledged their loyalty to.

It is the prerogative of members of the House of Assembly to chose their leadership in line with the constitution and the law guiding the conduct of the Assembly.

Given that the Ogun electorate gave us a mandate to represent their best interests and deliver democratic dividends that will significantly improve their well-being; the Ogun State Government; along with the Party leadership; have intervened to ensure that whatever disagreement members have is resolved peacefully and amicably; so that the delivery of democratic dividends to our people will not be hampered in any way.

The Ogun State Government considers all members of the House of Assembly as partners in the Building our Future agenda and will always prioritise issues that affect them.

E signed.

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY GRANTS FULL AUTONOMY TO THE 774 LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF NIGERIA AS INEC IS NOW TO CONDUCT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS...

"The National Assembly on Tuesday; granted full financial and administrative autonomy to all the 774 local council authorities across Nigeria by amending section 124 of the nation’s constitution.

The section provides a consequential provision for the making of the local councils; a full third tier government without undue interference from the state governments.

The ammendment was one of the 22 others approved by the House of Representatives last week and ratified by the Senate on Tuesday.

Both chambers had through a conference committee harmonised versions of the ammendments into the constitution carried out by each of them last month.

By the development; the National Assembly had ratified all the 23 clauses and sections that had been ammended by both chambers.

The newly ammended document which would be sent to States Houses of Assembly; for approval; also approved the creation of the Office of Auditor General of the Local Government as well as the State Local Government Service Commission.

The section equally deleted the State
Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC) from the constitution thereby vesting the powers to conduct council elections on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

It however; retained the immunity clause in the constitution for the President and Governors by adopting the Senate version of the ammendments on the issue and rejected the House of Representatives version which removed the immunity clause.

The National Assembly also made provisions for Independent Candidacy in future elections in Nigeria by amending sections 65 and 106 of the 1999 constitution..."

[27/01/2024; 04;59;08] Alfa Gafaru Council; *Femi Adesina; a former special adviser on media and publicity to ex-President Muhammadu Buhari; has disclosed how the late Chief of State to the president; Abba Kyari; frustrated his work for five years.*

*According to him; Mr Kyari denied him unhindered access to Mr Buhari despite the president’s directive to that effect.*

*Mr Kyari; who was accused of being a top member of the cabal of the Buhari presidency; died of COVID-19 complications on April 17; 2020; in Lagos.*

The ex-presidential media aide made the revelations in his book; ‘Working with Buhari; Reflections of a Special Adviser; Media; and Publicity.

He also alleged that the late COS prevented the funding of media operations of the presidential media directorate until his death.

“In June 2015; I had done a memo to the President recommending some people to be taken on as staff in the Media Department. They had gone through the campaign and struggles with us and pedestaled themselves as dyed-in-the-wool Buharists. They were from different parts of the country.

“I explained that much to Mr. President the day I took the memo to him. He thanked me and said he would pass it to the SGF (Secretary to Government of the Federation) when he appointed one; so it would be on record. Fair enough.

“When a COS (Chief of Staff) and SGF were appointed; the President directed the memo to the COS. Also in order. But Malam Kyari just sat on it for the next one year. He did not say anything on it.

“Eventually; my colleague; Garba Shehu; went to see him. And he confessed to Shehu that he shunned the memo because I had taken it directly to the president. But the June date on it was clear. He had not even been appointed then.

“The second had to do with funding of the media department. There was no budget line; and funds were usually provided by the Office of the NSA; as needs arose. I had consulted with two of my predecessors; Dr. Reuben Abati and Ima Niboro; who had briefed me.

“Media and publicity is not cheap; not anywhere in the world; but it would amaze you that we operated for five years without a dime. After the NSA was appointed; I went to meet and brief him about how publicity was usually funded from his office. It was a Friday; and he promised that anything that would make me and the man we had come to serve succeed; he would do.

“Exactly a week later; after the Jumat service; the NSA walked into my office; with his two hands in the air. I asked what the matter was. He told me he had received a memo from the President directing that nothing; absolutely nothing; must be funded from his office; except security. In the light of that; the promise he had made me was no longer tenable.

“I thanked him and said I would meet the president. And I did. That very night; in the house. I remember that it was only myself and General Dambazau that were waiting to see him. He is a senior friend; and I told him the purpose of my visit.

“He was quite surprised that over three months; media and publicity was not being funded yet. He asked how we were doing it; and I said myself and Shehu were using goodwill. When I met the President and told him of my encounter with the NSA; he confirmed that he gave the directive and explained why.”

He quoted Buhari as saying; “A lot was done through the Office of the NSA; and there were no records. I do not want that. We will institute a probe into the activities of the office (it was eventually done); and you will see what happened there. I don’t want the media funded from there again.

“Meet the Chief of Staff and let him design how we would be funding media.”

Mr Adesina further said; “The next day; I went to see the COS in the office. I had just started talking; when he impatiently started to say; ‘No; no; no. Media is not funded from here. Media is not funded from here.’ He would not even give me a chance to talk. And lest I appear as someone just after funding; for what I would gain; I left his office and never went back to the President. For the first five years; the media did not receive one naira until the SGF; Boss Mustapha; heard about it and designed a budget line from his office.

“It was not up to what was required; but it was better than nothing. Third encounter. A retired general; someone well respected in the country; had wanted to see the president.

“Many times; he applied through the office of COS; which is the proper channel. He never got feedback. So he phoned and asked me to intervene since the issue he wanted to discuss was quite serious. I went to the president and mentioned the general and why he needed to come see him.

“The President just said; ‘Tell SCOP to schedule him for 8;00 pm tomorrow in the house.’ I passed on the word and left for my office. I had not been seated for five minutes when my intercom rang. It was the COS who wanted me to come to his office.

“He started screaming as I entered; ‘Why did you get an appointment for Gen..? Why did you? You always go behind me to relate with the president. You have to stop it.’

“Remember the President’s instructions to me the day I resumed work; ‘Do not let anybody stop you from seeing me. Anytime you need to see me; just come.’ I never abused that rain check but went to see the President only when it was totally necessary; throughout the eight years. And he was always gracious to me.

“But apparently; it became an issue with Malam Abba; so we were not quite chummy; but we were also not enemies”; he disclosed.

My discussion with him in recent times beyoud the shores of Nigeria vis-a-vis leadership and governance was a life changing conviction about this man.

If he decides to run again;  that would be a fantastic move to keep the ball rooling for a greater Agbado-Okeodo.  

Mr. The project is my hero in Agbado-okeodo Politics! I wish him all the very best. Whatever needs to be done; I would give him my support.

[28/01/2024; 08;36;07] Ward D Presy; @ Fasasi @ Reformer; instead of putting a call through to any of the admins you are acting as if calling them here will make them know their attention is needed. Am saying this for next time; anyone can notify the admin when there's a violation of our collective decision. Am in church and just came online cause am part of the media team not to check WhatsApp. ‎<This message was edited>
[28/01/2024; 08;37;29] Comrade Obadina; We must be careful with what we are posting on this platform.

Everybody is entitled to his/her opinion.

It's not for us to say somebody is not entitled to a position if you are interested you as well qualified.

This platform has enjoyed relatively calmness.

Admin should please delete this post.

I'm not doing because I'm in support of the Chairman but for fairness;equity and justice.

Agbado Oke Odo youth has gone pass this stage ;we know those that doesn't want the youth to grow not Famuyiwa.

[29/01/2024; 07;28;42] Alfa Gafaru Council; *The Federal Government has ordered immediate suspension of reconstruction work on the Eleme-Onne section of the East-West Road in Rivers State.*

Minister of Works; David Umahi; gave the order in Port Harcourt; yesterday; during a media chat with newsmen.
Umahi said the decision followed the use of sub-standard materials by the contractor handling the project.

The minister; who noted that he had carried out inspection of ongoing work the previous day on the projects; expressed sadness over the slow pace of work even after government made an advance payment of N33 billion to ensure that no sharp practice was recorded.

He maintained that the work has to stop pending when some irregularities concering the project were resolved.
He said; “The project must benefit the people; we don’t care. The raining season is coming in two months and the people will keep suffering. You have our N33 billion. Do you know how the interest rate is every month on the bill?

“The President had to order me in September to come here and ordered the payment because some Rivers State indigenes went to see the President and we paid you N33 billion from that time till now.

“I saw that the sand they are using; it is not river sharp. What we paid for is river sharp sand. I’m not satisfied. And so; the sand will fill it and it becomes a compact monolitic pavement structure. When I saw that sand; I wasn’t happy. And I took that sand and put it on my palm and poured water and as I was squizzing it; at the end of the day; there was nothing left.

“That confirmed that it very clear. So; I directed that the company should be written and they should ensure that they remove the sand. I was very shocked that instead of removing the sand; they had continued with the sand.

“The contractor is carrying out the job; but at snail speed. If we allow him even another five years; he will not finish it. So we are not going to allow him.”

God is saying to you today;
"I know that you are struggling hard right now. I know your finances are tight. I know you are trying hard to deal with all of the things that life is throwing at you.
I know you feel like giving up sometimes; but I want you to lean on Me. I will show you the way; because I am the way.
I have a blessing with your name on it. Don't give up before the blessing comes." ♥️🙏🏽

Lets ask a question; can you match the movement led by the one and only Abdullahi Ayinde Enilolobo?

Did your collective leaders have the charisma of Enilolobo in Lagos Politics?

Would Baba Eto dip hands in Alimosho politics?

Would Obasa leave Agege as the speaker and truncate Alimosho political existence? 

A mere strategy photograph have now become a news coined with lies abi?

VP SHETTIMA SEEKS MORE SUPPORT FOR FG’S JOB CREATION; AGRICULTURE; E-MOBILITY AGENDA 

*Receives Tony Blair Institute’s Global MD At Presidential Villa

The Vice President; Sen. Kashim Shettima; has implored development partners to provide more support for the Tinubu administration to deliver on the Renewed Hope Agenda; especially in priority areas such as e-mobility; job creation; agriculture; food security and the power sector; among others.

He said delivering on the priority areas will help in addressing some of the challenges bedeviling the country; particularly the security situation occasioned by terrorism; kidnapping and banditry.

The Vice President stated this on Monday when he received the Global Managing Director of the Tony Blair Institute; Mr Michael McNair; who was on a courtesy visit to the Presidential Villa.

Sen. Shettima who noted the commitment of the Tinubu administration to delivering on the Renewed Hope Agenda said; “It is easy to talk but how to walk the talk is the most important component of leadership”. 

On more support to the Tinubu administration’s drive to deepen the deployment and use of e-vehicles for public transportation; the Vice President urged the TBI to make available its expertise in enhancing the adoption of the technology in Nigeria.

“I crave your indulgence to support us in e-mobility. We want your perspective and your input on the deployment and use of e-mobility; we want to adopt and adhere to global best practices;” he noted.

The VP applauded TBI’s partnership with Nigeria; especially in the nation's "effort to deepen the quality of governance and leadership in priority areas of job creation; agriculture and food security; support for the power sector through the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) and the delivery unit that will track our efforts.” 

According to him; given the burden of Nigeria’s growing population with all of its implications; government must "improve on the quality of governance. 

"There is no magic wand beyond delivering the dividends of democracy to the people. Once we create jobs and engage the youths; the challenges of terrorism; kidnappings and banditry will be drastically curtailed;” he added. 

On his part; the Global Managing Director of the Tony Blair Institute; Mr Michael McNair; commended President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Vice President Kashim Shettima's leadership; noting that the VP’s impressive outing at the World Economic Forum; particularly his commitment to Africa’s future; was indicative of the country’s direction. 

McNair said he was in Nigeria to appraise the work started by the TBI team in the country; particularly in supporting the new administration to deliver on set goals; stressing that “TBI’s success is in helping the administration to achieve its mandate across different sectors”. 

He said the Institute is committed to supporting growth and development in Africa and Nigeria in particular in key areas identified by the administration; noting that the organisation is prepared to deploy additional resources to achieve target objectives in the country. 

Also present at the meeting with the VP were TBI Regional Director; Anglophone West & Central Africa; Ope-Oluwa Adejoro; TBI Country Director for Nigeria; Joy Dariye; and senior executives at the Institutte; Ahmed Ibrahim and Victor Adamu.

Tinubu rules out Edu’s reinstatement
…Suspended Minister indicts President’s aide

By Our Correspondent

President Bola Tinubu has ruled out the possibility of reinstating Dr Betta Edu as Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation.

The President suspended Edu from office on January 8 for her alleged involvement in financial scandal running into billions of Naira belonging to the ministry.

Edu was found to have illegally approved payment of hundreds of millions of Naira to some private companies and civil servants in contravention of extant rules.

One of the payments was the N585 million paid into the United Bank for Africa (UBA) account of a project accountant in the Humanitarian Affairs Ministry. A company belonging to the Minister of Interior; Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo was also reported to have received N438 million payment for unverifiable contract.

The suspended Minister is currently being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) while Tunji-Ojo is being investigated by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC).

However; some prominent chieftains of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are reported to be mounting pressure on the President to give Edu a soft landing.

It was gathered on Sunday that the party leaders hinged their pleas on the fact that Edu; in her previous position as National Woman Leader of the APC; played a key role in mobilising support for Tinubu’s election during the last electioneering.

They reminded the President that it was in recognition of her contribution to the victory of the APC in the last presidential election that earned her the ministerial appointment in the first place.

A top party source privy to the rapprochement moves; told our correspondent on Sunday; that party leaders were however not unmindful of the effects of the Edu scandal on the image of the APC at the national level.

The source; who did not want his name in print; said; “It was a difficult task trying to convince President Tinubu to give Edu a soft landing despite the fact that she payed a prominent role during the residential campaign.

“Edu wept profusely when some of our leaders managed to prevail on the President to grant her audience a few days ago. But the president was not moved one bit.

“President Tinubu did not mince words in telling her and the party leaders pleading on her behalf that she should forget about reinstatement. However; the President left everyone guessing regarding her ongoing investigation by the EFCC”.

Another source confirmed to our correspondent that Edu named one of the President’s top aides as her enabler. The said aide is known to be one of the President’s long standing political associates.

Tinubu was said to have been taken aback by the revelation of the aide’s deep involvement in Edu’s reckless looting of public treasury and the effects on the administration’s anti corruption campaign.

A source in the Presidency said the President has tactically stripped the top aide of his official functions and has delegated the responsibilities of his office to two other officials in the Presidency.

Other multiple sources said the President had placed the influential aide on security watch shortly before he travelled to France last week on a private visit.

It was reliably gathered that Tinubu’s initial plan was to send the errant aide packing; but that on a second thought; he felt it was rather too early to kick out such a prominent aide barely seven months into his administration.

“President Tinubu was scandalised by the involvement of his close associate in the huge financial scandal perpetrated by Betta Edu. He felt disappointed that one of those he trusted to drive his administration’s anti corruption campaign has turned out to join the corruption bandwagon so early in the life of the administration.

“I am not in a position to answer your question as to whether or not the President is going to fire him anytime soon because I cannot read his mind. That is strictly left to him since he alone has the prerogative to hire and fire”; one of the sources said.

There have been a deluge of corruption allegations involving other top officials of the administration. The Minister of Works; Dave Umahi is presently in the eye of the storm over alleged payment of some N9 billion to a Microfinance bank for unspecified project.

Also; the Chief of Naval Staff; Vice Admiral Emmanuel Ogalla; is contending with allegations of receiving $170 million in bribes and releasing several vessels seized for illegal oil bunkering and oil thieves.

Although both the Works Minister and the Naval Chief have come out to defend their positions through their establishments the allegations have continued to gain traction in the public space.

A Paramount Ruler with a lot of Baales are better arrangement. That was how Yorubaland was found. There will be a Paramount ruler with many Baales. That's why we have a saying BAALE OKO ILU.*

FINALLY; if you cut corners during the Coronation and installation; the Oba will not have special power. The Oba will just be like you and me. When you meet an Oba suddenly; you must be afraid; bc of the Sango influence on him. But nowadays; all important Initiations will be skipped.

Recently; I watched a ceremony by Gani Adams. He lined up over 100 Obas. He lorded it over them. It was inside a well decorated hall. He talked with authority bc Adams did not skip any of his Aare Ona Kakanfo Initiation rites.

Shame; two Ekiti Obas were gunned down just like that by young Malians !!!! Many students were also taken into the Forest.

[30/01/2024; 09;50;35] ; Afeez Alaran; *Read the below story and see for yourself the true situation of our society called Nigeria.*

A man went to a rich man's house; found him seated in the company of his friends. He greeted the big man and in tears; said; "Sir; I am a poor man. I ate last yesterday afternoon and have had nothing to eat again since then. I have been looking for any kind of job without luck. My wife has delivered a baby boy at home last night and she too has eaten nothing; preventing her breast milk from flowing. The baby has since been crying out of hunger.
I came to you to plead for assistance. I do not need money; just foodstuff; even that; no need to give me directly. I prefer your driver accompany me; deliver the items directly to my family and see things for himself."

The rich man thought deeply; then called his driver and said; "Here; take this N50;000 and a bag of rice. Take this man to his house. If he shows you a woman with a newborn baby; give him the money and the rice. If; for any reason you don't see them; return the gifts to me."

The driver took the man in his car and they drove into the city. They reached a house and the man entered; then came out and said that the nursing mother was not in. The driver said the husband should phone her to come back to enable him fulfill his duty.
The man said she had no phone. The driver said he would then wait till she returned.

When the man noticed the driver was bent on doing as his boss ordered; he looked at him straight in the eye and said; "I have a proposal for you. Forget about woman or no woman. Take the rice and give me the  money." But the driver refused. The man then said; "Ok; let's do it this way. Take the rice and let us share the  money". Still the driver refused. The man finally asked him; "How much do you really want?" The driver said; "I want nothing other than either to see the woman and hand over the items to you; or I return all to my master".
The man looked at him angrily; hissed and simply walked away.

🌹 When the man walked away; the driver stopped at a roadside shop and told the owner he needed cash urgently; so he would sell his N20;000 bag of rice for N15;000. The shop owner quickly paid and offloaded the rice.

The driver went home and informed his master that he had carried out the assignment. His master asked him if the poor man's story was true and he said he really saw the nursing mother. The master then said; "Good. Now take me to the family to enable me assist them more properly".

The driver took the rich man towards the city; but while the car a/c was on; the master noticed the driver was sweating profusely; his hand was shaking on the steering; and his speech was incoherent.
The master ordered him to park and asked what the problem was. Seeing there was no point lying; the driver confessed to the the other man's and his own guilt. He handed over the N50;000 and the N15;000 for the rice and begged for mercy. He then drove them back home.

The rich man told his friends what happened and said; "This is the problem with our society. 
Someone will seek your help. Unknown to you; he is a fraudster. If you help him; he has cheated you and will continue. If you don't; you feel guilty because you are not sure. Society will also say you are merciless.
Similarly; someone will ask for a job; like this driver. If you reject him; you feel you are fuelling social problems. If you employ him; he cheats you. What kind of society is this? How can this problem be solved? Who can correct this anomaly?"

Neither the rich man nor his friends could answer the questions because honesty has become a rare commodity in our society..... guess what?  These people are not government or the leadership.  They are the same people that complain everyday about the LEADERS.

*DON'T SHIFT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACHERS OR POLITICIANS.*

It is *AT HOME* that children should learn to say; 
 
01 - Hello 
02 - Good afternoon 
03 - Good evening 
04 - Please 
05 - May I 
06 - Sorry 
07 - Forgive me 
08 - Thank you very much 
09 - Thank you 
10 - I was wrong 
11 - God bless you
 
It is *AT HOME* that we also learn to; 
 
01 - Be honest 
02 - Be punctual 
03 - Not to insult 
04 - Be polite 
05 - Respect everyone; friends; colleagues; elders; teachers; authorities 
 
Again *at home* we learn to; 
 
01 - Eat responsibly. 
02 - Not speak with a mouth full 
03 - Observe personal hygiene 
04 - Not throw waste anyhow
05 - Help parents accomplish their daily tasks 
06 - Do not take what does not belong to us.
 
Still *At home* we learn to; 
 
01 - Be organized 
02 - Take care of our; parents; siblings; and business 
03 - Not touch other people's belongings 
04 - Respect the rules and laws
05 - Speak our mother tongue(s); master our unharmful native culture that does not conflict with God's commandments.
06 - Learn not to Hate.
07 - How to resist pride and self-aggrandizement.
 
Because *AT SCHOOL* teachers are meant to teach; among other things;
 
■ Mathematics 
■ English 
■ History 
■ Literature
■ Government
■ Geography 
■ Foreign language 
■ Social Science 
■ Chemistry 
■ Physics 
■ Biology 
■ Philosophy 
■ Sociology 
■ Physical education 
■ Art
■ Civic Studies
■ Economics
■ Religious Studies
■  Agric Science
■ Commerce
■ Home Economics
■ Technical Drawing; 
... which only reinforces what the student learned *AT HOME* !!! 

This is because OUR HOME upbringing determines the respect we command in our lifetime

*To All Families; Let Us Pursue This Cause Together As One!!!*

*YES; IT IS MY BUSINESS!* 

We are in a time when evils are upheld; and even defended; at the expense of the good.

Have you observed that in recent times; people don't like to hear the truth about their children's abnormal behavior?

Have you also noticed that some "accidental parents" will call you all kinds of names and even threaten to deal with you; just because you tried to correct some errors in their parenting?

This happens; especially on social media. 

And before you know it; you are bombarded with tons of abuses for making statements that did NOT go down well with their ill-parenting method.

And their _harsh_ responses most often start with; "How does it concern you? Is it your business how other people raise their children? Can't you mind your own business?... etc; etc."

I want to tell everyone here that _it is my business_ how you raise your children. 

And it should also be your business how I raise mine; if you are indeed a parent.

🔴 It is my business because; your ill-parented child will corrupt other children; including mine.

🔴 It is my business because; you are likely to raise more hoodlums; prostitutes; drug addicts; rapists; etc.; in addition to the ones we already have in my society; thereby making the environment unconducive and unsafe for everyone.

🔴 It is my business because you may raise bullies and send them to the same school where normal children are. 

And we cannot afford to continue to have our innocent children recruited into dens of immorality erected by your untamed bulldogs; who you register as students in our sane children's schools.

🔴 It is my business because I am praying to be a father-in-law/mother-in-law of an innocent child brought home to me. 

What if fate brings them together with your ill-parented son or daughter; whom you have craftily taught the art of deceit and pretense? 

Wouldn't that mean that I may spend the rest of my life in bitterness watching my son or daughter going through pains in their marriage?

🔴 How you parent your children is my business because every well-parented child is a special gift from God to humanity.

Who knows whether that child you are spoiling or neglecting today will be my destiny helper tomorrow?

🔴 Don't tell me to mind my business when you are raising charlatans for the waste; rather than those who would make positive impacts and contributions to mankind.

🔴 Stop telling me to mind my business because I am a stakeholder in the upbringing of every child born in this time and season. 

Every good parent knows that we are all stakeholders in this business of raising the next generation.

Posterity will judge us if we see or hear evil and keep mute.

 Let's get started; pls 🙏
Thank you

[30/01/2024; 23;56;22] Obafemi Oshungboye; The essence of our existence is often shaped by the visions we hold in the quiet corners of our minds. The dreams we dare to dream lay the foundation for the reality we ultimately live. They are the seeds from which our actions sprout; and the blueprints that guide our journey towards achievement.

"We are all product of our dreams;" serves as a profound reminder that our aspirations are not just fleeting thoughts but the very substance that can mold our future. Your dreams are the architects of your destiny; and the courage to dream is the first step in building the life you desire.

So I encourage you; dare to dream. Dream boldly and without limits. Let your dreams stretch the horizons of your imagination and inspire you to reach beyond your current circumstances. Remember that every great accomplishment once existed as a dream in someone's heart before it became a tangible reality.

Embrace your dreams; for they are the vital pulse of your potential. They are the whispers of your soul hinting at what you can become. Dream; and then transform those dreams into plans. Plans into actions. And actions into the unfolding story of your life; where you are not just a spectator but the lead actor on the stage of your own magnificent journey.

Dare to dream; for in doing so; you open the door to endless possibilities. Your dreams are your future waiting to be created. They empower you; they give you purpose; and they guide you towards greatness. So hold onto them; nurture them; and let them soar; for they are the essence of who you are and all you can become.
